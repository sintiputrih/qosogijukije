Their rollercoaster relationship went from awkward to loving to non-existent. Even though Neil asked for a divorce, fans held out hope that Sneil would someday rekindle their romance.</p><p>Today, it looks as though Sam and Neil are still in each others lives… as friends… we think…</p><p>Sam is active on social media but doesn’t reveal too many details about her personal life. She admitted that she’s still friends with Neil and called him a “pretty cool dude” when asked about him on Twitter.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Of course!! Neil's a pretty cool dude! ☺️ <a href=#>https://t.co/Mbl2SNMHjh</a></p><p>— Sam Role (@Sam_MAFS) <a href=#>June 26, 2016</a></p><p>Back in May, Sam shared a picture with Neil wishing him a happy birthday. You can clearly see Neil is wearing a ring on his left hand which immediately raised suspicion about the status of their relationship.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async title="Sam and Neil MAFS" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sam-and-Neil-MAFS.png alt="Sam and Neil MAFS" width=490 height=483 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>However, Neil was photographed wearing the exact same outfit at a viewing party for the season finale back in March.</p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A photo posted by David Norton (@therealdavenorton)</a> on Feb 23, 2016 at 7:17pm PST</p><p>We’re going to go out on a limb and guess that Sam’s birthday post was an old photo. #Bummer</p><p>As a way to keep her fans guessing, Sam posted another picture with the caption:</p><p>Look mom, no hands!!! ?Glad @superbowlus and I got to…..

During the taping of MAFS, she was a branch manager for Sun Trust. According to LinkedIn, she is now Manager of Client Services for ADP, a human resource company.</p><p>Neil, on the other hand, has been pretty low-key when it comes to social media. His Instagram is private and almost all of his Tweets relate to MAFS.</p><p>It appears he’s still working his 9-5 as a Compliance Specialist at QualTex Laboratories, but little else is known about Neil post reality TV.</p><p>Back in May, he shared a pic with Sam celebrating his birthday.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thanks @srole01 for the birthday meal!! <a href=#>#wehadsushi</a> <a href=#>#marriedatfirstsight</a> ????????✅ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/1naQGdQdtd</a></p><p>— Neil Bowlus (@Neil_MAFS) <a href=#>May 25, 2016</a></p><p>One thing is certain, both Sam and Neil love to keep us guessing!</p><p><strong>UPDATE:Vanessa & Tres</strong></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async title=vanessa-and-tres src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/vanessa-and-tres.jpg alt=vanessa-and-tres width=490 height=420 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The future looked promising for Tres and Vanessa. After all, they were the only couple who agreed to stay married at the end of the experiment. Sadly, their happiness didn’t last, and the relationship was over soon after the show wrapped.</p><p>It was clear Vanessa was shaken up by split while Tres seemed anxious to rejoin the single world.</p><p>Today, Tres appears to be enjoying life to the fullest. He’s still selling luxury cars and, by the looks of it, is single. But that doesn’t mean he’s lonely.</p><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Follow my new favorite sisters @tm_kirkpat and @ekirkpat11 @bartacolife #Buckhead #ATL #NewFriends</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A photo posted by tres_russell (@tres_russell) on Jun 29, 2016 at 5:41pm PDT</p><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Cocktail reception with the crew #VegasCosmeticSurgery #Bellagio #Vegas #FrenchConnection @dee_smith_ @e_chai</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A photo posted by tres_russell (@tres_russell) on Jun 9, 2016 at 8:05pm PDT</p><p>Even though things didn’t work out with Vanessa, Tres says he’s happy to have gone through the experience. “I am forever grateful to Vanessa, The Experts, and everyone involved,” he said of his time on the show.</p><p>“The transformation that I have made as a man over the past year simply amazes me and I have this experience to thank for that,” Tres explained. “It is very unfortunate that it did not have the ending that we had all hoped for, but I don’t regret it for a minute.

Last month, we announced that she will star alongside David in <a href=#>Married at Sight: Second Chances</a>. The show will attempt to match Vanessa with another, more compatible partner.</p><p>Based on the format for the new show, we’re guessing Vanessa hasn’t found Mr. Right… at least not yet.</p><p>In the meantime, she founded <a href=#>She-Spark.com</a> a “growing community for women who want to get inspired and get moving towards their best life.” The site focuses on career, health, and food.</p><p></p><p><strong>UPDATE: Ashley and David</strong></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async title=david-ashley src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/david-ashley.jpg alt=david-ashley width=490 height=398 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Let’s face it, their relationship was a train wreck from the start.

He started a new job back in May as a Project Manager for N3, a sales firm that specializes in technology, software and manufacturing.</p><p>Since appearing on Married at First Sight, Ashley has completely distanced herself from the show. Her social media accounts are private with the exception of a sparse Twitter page. She doesn’t follow anyone associated with the show besides Jaclyn and Jessica from season 2.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async title="MAFS Girls" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MAFS-Girls.png alt="MAFS Girls" width=490 height=427 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>It’s no secret Ashley struggled to connect with David during their marriage. She came across as cold and unwelcoming while David was portrayed as lovable and willing to do anything to make his marriage work. As a result, fans of the show berated Ashley and even threatened her life.</p><p>When you consider the public scrutiny she endured, it’s easy to understand why she’s reluctant to share her life with strangers.</p><p>Ashley is still in enrolled as a nursing student and is set to graduate in 2017.</p><p>When the show aired, many assumed that Ashley was getting a late start in her education because she was still taking classes as a 30-year-old. However, you may be surprised to learn Ashley earned a B.S. in Psychology as well as a Master of Social Work before starting nursing school.</p><p>****************************************************************</p><p>Here’s a sneak peek of the new season of Married at First Sight premiering tonight!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nice to marry you. <a href=#>#MarriedAtFirstSight</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/9uTzevTkO3</a></p><p>— A&E Network (@AETV) <a href=#>July 16, 2016</a></p><p>And if you’re curious about the cast from season 2, be sure to check out our previous “Where are they now?” post by clicking <a href=#>here</a>!</p><p><strong>Don’t forget to catch new episodes of Married at First Sight when it airs on Tuesdays at 8/7c FYI.</strong></p><p>PHOTOS: Instagram/Twitter</p><p><br><br></p><a title="web stats" href=# class=statcounter><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/c.statcounter.com/10002269/0/47594904/1/ alt="web stats" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p><br></p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><span class="share-item twitterbtn"><a href=# class=twitter-share-button data-via=starcasm>Tweet</a></span> <span class="share-item gplusbtn"></span><span class="share-item facebookbtn"></span><span class="share-item pinbtn"><a href=# class=pin-it-button count-layout=horizontal>Pin It</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FpK3SpmWnnaRkuqK%2B0aKcnWWRqXqntdGsq2armZy1tXnSnpisp55igG7Dx56pnmWRp7JuwMeesGamn6x8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jesters.html><span>←</span><span>Jesters, The 'Fools' Who Once Entertained Royal Courts</span></a>
