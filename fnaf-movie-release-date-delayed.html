<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>FNAF Movie Release Date Delayed: Why Director Chris Columbus Has Left the Project?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>FNAF Movie Release Date Delayed:</strong> A film version of the popular video game series Five Nights at Freddy’s has been in the works for a long time, and it will finally hit theaters in 2023.</p><p>The movie will be a huge success with lovers of the source material and horror fans in general because it is based on popular survival horror video games. In addition, it debuts at a time when fright flicks are more popular than ever before, which could render one of the film’s marketing strategies obsolete.</p><p>Peacock will debut Five Nights at Freddy’s at the same time it hits theaters. This is a relic from when movies were released like an epidemic, and it doesn’t make much sense today. The worst-case scenario is that the movie’s box office earnings are severely diminished, thus ending the franchise at the theater.</p><h2>“Back At Square One” from “Five Nights at Freddy’s”</h2><p>Scott Cawthon said in a statement shared on Steam in January 2017 that they were “back at square one” with the Five Nights at Freddy’s film. Cawthon was unhappy with how the FNAF movie was developing under Warner Bros. after an initially positive start.</p><p>Explaining further, Cawthon said, “The reality is that last year the FNaF movie was met with several delays and roadblocks, some involving problems within the movie industry as a whole.”</p><p><img alt="Fnaf Movie Release Date Delayed" width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3-106.jpg></p><p>Between April 2015 and January 2017, Cawthon did not elaborate on the particular issues that delayed the development of the Five Nights at Freddy’s film.</p><p>It appears that Cawthon was unhappy with the Five Nights at Freddy’s scripts proposed by Warner Bros., as he has claimed that he would retain considerably greater influence going ahead. Cawthon then attempted, with varied results, to compose an FNAF script that he would find satisfying.</p><h2>The Original Five Nights at Freddy’s Script Was Scrapped by Cawthon</h2><p>In May 2017, Blumouse took over production from Warner Bros., and in February 2018, it was revealed that renowned director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter) will helm the film and compose the script with Cawthon. After collaborating with Kira Breed-Wrisley, co-author of the Five Nights at Freddy’s novel series, Cawthon penned a screenplay for the franchise.</p><p>According to Variety, in November of 2018,&nbsp;Cawthon decided he was still unhappy with the story and scrapped his own script. Cawthon blamed himself for the delay despite having Chris Columbus’ and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum’s blessing on an alternate plan. The movie adaptation of Five Nights at Freddy’s was back at the beginning of production after three years.</p><h2>Five Nights At Freddy’s Director Chris Columbus Has Left The Project</h2><p>Director <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chris Columbus</a> left the Five Nights at Freddy’s film as writer Tom Cawthon was hard at work on a fresh script, as reported by Collider. In September 2021, Blum revealed that Columbus would no longer be involved with the film in any capacity, including as writer or director.</p><p><img alt="Fnaf Movie Release Date Delayed" width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-109.jpg></p><p>Considering Columbus’s stellar track record with kid-friendly horror films like Gremlins, this was a major setback. So far, there has been no word on why Columbus left Five Nights at Freddy’s. Jason Blum reassured fans after Christopher Columbus’s resignation by saying that Five Nights at Freddy’s director Tom Cawthon will get the “final cut” of the film and the script.</p><h2>The Difficulty of Five Nights at Freddy’s Backstory Caused Production Delays</h2><p>The intricate backstory of Five Nights at Freddy was a hindrance all through the drawn-out pre-production process, slowing down the FNAF movie script significantly with each revision.</p><p>Preparing a movie adaptation of the FNAF franchise, which spans 13 games and over 30 books and graphic novels, was an enormous challenge for all of the writers involved.</p><p>Jason Blum said, “It’s taken longer than I hoped to get the right story,” apparently alluding to the time it took for Cawthon to go through his own complicated backstory and FNAF mythos.</p><p>Read More:</p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Citadel Season 2 Renewed or Canceled Status on Prime Video!</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Oshi No Ko Season 2 is Officially Confirmed: Check Out for Further Information</a></li></ul><p>By 2021, Five Nights at Freddy’s had gone through 10 distinct drafts written by Cawthon before he settled on the “Mike Script.” Thankfully, casting had begun by October 2022 after the appointment of Emma Tammi as director.</p><p>Filming for Five Nights at Freddy’s wrapped up in April 2023, following eight years of preparation, signaling that fans’ long wait for the FNAF film is almost over.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Five Nights at Freddy’s is based on popular survival horror video games and debuts at a time when fright flicks are more popular. Scott Cawthon was unhappy with the scripts proposed by Warner Bros. and scrapped his own script in November 2018.</p><p>Five Nights at Freddy’s director Tom Cawthon will get the “final cut” of the film and the script, despite the difficulty of the backstory, which caused production delays.</p><p>We’re hoping this content proves to be helpful to you… Wow, I really appreciate you reading this!
