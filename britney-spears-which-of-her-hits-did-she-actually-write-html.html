However, <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> actually wrote a few of her hits… just not most of them. Here’s a look at which of her <a href=#>hits she penned herself</a>.</p><h2 id=h-the-time-britney-spears-made-a-hit-with-someone-who-meant-a-lot-to-her>The time Britney Spears made a hit with someone who meant a lot to her</h2><p id=par-2_43>Spears has co-written dozens of songs over the years. It would take lots of time to catalog all of them. Here’s a look at only the songs the “<a href=#>Piece of Me</a>” singer co-wrote that reached the top 40 on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard Hot 100</a>.</p><p id=par-3_42>When people think of early Spears songs, they think of dance-pop. Singles like “…Baby One More Time” and “(You Drive Me) Crazy” are fun dance-floor songs with an undeniable funky groove. However, the first hit Spears co-wrote is somewhat different from this.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p>“(You Drive Me) Crazy” music video</figure><p id=par-4_53>“Me Against the Music” has a heavy hip-hop influence that makes it different from the music Spears started out making. Interestingly, Spears co-wrote it. It also has a feature from Madonna. The track was a hit, although it was arguably overshadowed by another Spears/Madonna collaboration: their kiss at the MTV Video Music Awards.</p><p id=par-5_46>Spears and Madonna’s relationship was more than songs and PR stunts. “I don’t listen to anybody,” Spears told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sun-Sentinel</a>. “Nobody can tell me anything. I’m stubborn… But I do listen to Madonna. For some reason, I listen to her. I know that sounds really silly.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p>“Me Against the Music”</figure><p id=par-6_63>What advice did Madonna <a href=#>give to Spears</a>? “I don’t want to say,” Spears admitted. “But it’s nice to have somebody just to ask questions to. She’s a visual artist and a deep artist as well. I like the way she thinks. I wish I could be inside of her head.” She added, “I like Madonna’s career and what she’s done with her family.”</p><h2 id=h-the-musically-diverse-hits-britney-spears-wrote-afterward>The musically diverse hits Britney Spears wrote afterward</h2><p id=par-7_32>Proving her versatility as a songwriter, Spears’ next self-penned hit was “Everytime.” The low-key ballad involved vaguely menacing production, which sounds nothing like your usual Spears hit. However, Spears herself co-wrote it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p>“Everytime”</figure><p id=par-8_65>Several years passed before the “<a href=#>Oops I Did It Again</a>” singer wrote a song that reached the Billboard Hot 100. Then Rihanna released her smash “S&M.” The original version of “S&M” is a solo song by Rihanna, but a later remix features vocals from Spears. The later version of the song reached No. 1 on the Billboard, and it features a co-writing credit from Spears.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-spears-most-recent-self-penned-hits>Spears’ most recent self-penned hits</h2><p id=par-9_63>Spears also co-write “Work B*tch.” Of the hits she wrote, this is the first EDM song. It’s very much a product of its era, a time when EDM acts like the Swedish House Mafia, Avicci, and Krewella found chart success. The final hit she co-wrote, “Make Me….,” is a return to the sound of the R&B music she made <a href=#>earlier in her career</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvs7XTp5yyZaOlsqK%2B0mauoaGTnXqwsoyhnKtlmJ7BtHnDoptmq5iaeqKv066YpaSpYsSztdOeZaGsnaF8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natalia-grace-where-are-kristine-and-michael-barnett-now.html><span>←</span><span>Natalia Grace: Where are Kristine and Michael Barnett now?</span></a>
