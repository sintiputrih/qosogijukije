"Do you entertain the circus or do you watch it?" Hart quipped to Kendrick Perkins after the ESPN personality brought up Williams' interview. Furthermore, Hart joked that Williams had "bought the New York Knicks" only to "return them with a receipt". Additionally, Hart went after Williams' comments about being a voracious reader as a child.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Hart's first comments about Williams' interview came in the form of a tweet, which doubled as a promotion for his new movie. "Gotta get that anger up outcha champ‚Ä¶.It‚Äôs honestly sad. In the meantime‚Ä¶. Please enjoy MY MOVIE TRAILER to my next film ‚ÄúLIFT‚Äù which will be dropping on @netflix in 8 days!!!!! There is a moment in the trailer where @gugumbatharaw says ‚ÄúThey Really Love You‚Äù ‚Ä¶.I now know she‚Äôs talking about ‚ÄúKatt‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ Mark yo calendars world!!!! This one is SPECIAL!!!!" Hart wrote on X the day after Williams' interview aired.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-gilbert-arenas-defends-kevin-hart>Gilbert Arenas Defends Kevin Hart</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Gilbert Arenas spoke in defense of Kevin Hart after Katt Williams called Hart an industry plant. Arenas explained that Hart found success forging a career and succeeding in roles that Williams himself admitted to turning down. In Arenas' eyes, that didn't make Hart a plant, but instead, someone simply making do with the opportunities he could get. Furthermore, Arenas questioned why Williams was trying to diminish Hart's career for accepting the roles that Williams, as mentioned, had admitted to not wanting in the first place.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It echoes some of the comments that Michael Blackson made about Williams in his own response to the bombshell interview on Club Shay Shay. In a series of tweets, Blackson argued that while Williams was an all-time great of comedy, his interview was inflammatory by design. He argued that Williams was "trying to seem relevant" and should remember that he is not the "Katt Williams of 2005".</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
