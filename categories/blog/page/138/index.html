<a href=../../../../how-diabetes-and-high-blood-pressure-are-linked.html></a>
High blood pressure—also known as hypertension—and Type 2 diabetes are two of the most common medical conditions in the U.S. Unfortunately, they often occur together. Some research has found that 85% of middle-aged or older adults who have Type 2 diabetes also have hyper­tension, and both conditions elevate a person’s risk for heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.
These increased risks are significant, and in some cases grave. Researchers have found that people with Type 2 ­diabetes are up to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than those who don’t have the condition.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Roni Peiponen Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</h2><time>Mar 5, 2024</time>
