Similarly we saw a&nbsp;Blender test we saw back in August&nbsp;achieving the same feat. AMD at the time also fired up some power meters, showing that Ryzen power consumption in that test was a few watts lower than the Intel part, implying that AMD is meeting its targets for power, performance and as a result, efficiency.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/86/>← Prev Page</a>
