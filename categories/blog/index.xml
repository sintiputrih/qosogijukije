French actor Omar Sy is certainly starting to make a name for himself here in the U.S., with strong crossover performances in films like 2011’s The Intouchables and Michel Gondry’s trippy Mood Indigo (out later this year). While Hollywood has a habit of taking French actors and giving them villainous roles in heist movies, Sy’s next character will hopefully be something far more nuanced, as he has been added to the cast of Colin Trevorrow’s highly anticipated semi-sequel, Jurassic World.</description></item><item><title>Stars Who've Debuted Gray Hair Over the Years: Pics</title><link>/stars-whove-debuted-gray-hair-over-the-years-pics.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/stars-whove-debuted-gray-hair-over-the-years-pics.html</guid><description>Gray hair never goes out of style. From debuts on the red carpet to the big screen, celebs are no strangers to making headlines for showing off their silver strands.
Stars of all ages have experimented with the statement-making hair color, dyeing their strands with the help of an expert or embracing their natural hue.
One of the most notable dye jobs of recent is reality TV’s Caroline Manzo’s. In June 2020, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star “decided to embrace the gray” and with the help of a hair colorist, she made the look her own.</description></item><item><title>Almanzo Wilder</title><link>/almanzo-wilder.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/almanzo-wilder.html</guid><description>Almanzo Wilder estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles &amp;amp; many more details have been updated below.

そのチケットは爆発的な倍率で即完売し、
１０年ぶりに帰るコースト公演が間近に迫ってます。
細美武士さんの言動に注目が集まっていますが、
エルレが復活してからは、チケット絡みで悲しい話題が増えました。
ブログの更新はすっかりとストップしてますが、
エレルでの久々のライブに向けて、
音合わせやセットの調整などに忙しいそうなので、
そこは仕方ないですね・・・。
できれば音楽のことだけに集中して欲しいですが、
ファン的にはあのチケットの状況をなんとかして欲しいと、
細美武士さんのこれからの言動に注目が集まっています。
ブログも平和な話題が多いのですが、
エルレの公演が決まってからは、
ちょっとギスギスした印象になってのが悲しいです。
細美武士のﾌﾞﾛｸﾞやﾗｼﾞｵが素敵！
細美さんがブログに書く内容というのは、
音楽に纏わる話題も多いですが、
自分の旅行記なども書いたりするのです。
最近のアーティストのネットで発信することといえば、
他アーティストとの交流や、かっこいい写真などに溢れますが、
細美さんのブログはちょっと違います。
引用：細身ブログ
歳食っておじさんになったせいもあると思いますが、
写真の撮り方や文章がジャーナリスト寄りな感じです。。笑
さらには、たまに撮る自撮りも無機質で質素な感じ。これが逆にかっこよかったりするのですが。。
一番グッとくるのは、エルレの活動が休止した日に書くブログです。
毎年のように休止してどれだけの年月が経ったのか、自分なりに考えたブログを投稿するのです。世の中のほとんどのエルレファンが、エルレの休止を引きずっていましたが、細美さんも同じように考え続けていたのです。
ついに活動を再開させたということで、
そのドラマの繋がりが、より深く思えるのです。
ラジオに関してはまた違った一面を見せますが、
ライブのMCと、ブログと、ラジオと、
その違った顔１つ１つが良いバランスなのです。
全部、細美さんらしいのですが、
全てが同じように思えない、
でも一貫性がある。
これはすごいことです。素敵です。
ｴﾙﾚﾁｹｯﾄの転売と同行者募集者の下心 エルレの先行販売に応募した人の数は凄まじく、
二次まで落選の報告で溢れました。
一般が始まる前からチケットが４０万以上の値段で売られたり、
学生ファンのためにギリギリの価格で販売してるメンバーの気持ちは踏みにじられてます。
一般販売が始まる前から、
スマチケ限定に、分配はできない仕組みにし、
できるだけ転売に対して対策を打ってきました。
チケットが安いのに、
身分証明を確認するスタッフを配置するなど、
利益どころの話ではありません。
それでも行動してくれたエルレはやはりすごいです！
しかし、今度は別の問題も出ています。
それは「同行者募集」です。
当選した当人がいないと入場できない仕組みなので、
同行者を募集するという話を持ちかける方が多いのですが、
その同行者の条件が、かなり悪質なのです。
まず、若い女性でなければいけなかったり、
物販や交通費、ホテル代を負担させたり、
チケット代に数万を要求したり、やりたい放題です。
ツイッターでは、同行者が見つかったものの、
同じホテルに泊まらせてくれないかと言われたり、
朝まで一緒にいることをお願いされ、断った瞬間に、
「もっと条件の良い方が見つかりました」と破談になった報告もあります。
ホテルに行っていいって言われてるってことは、
きっとその女性はすでにホテルを予約済みだったのでしょう、
それが破談になったってかなり痛いですね。
お金の次は下心でエルレファンを悩ます層が登場したことで、
この問題は永久的に続きそうだなと・・・。
細美武士さんはその件に関して言及するかわかりませんが、</description></item><item><title>Anya Taylor-Joy Height</title><link>/anya-taylor-joy-height.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/anya-taylor-joy-height.html</guid><description>Anya Taylor-Joy is a professional Actress&amp;nbsp;and she&amp;nbsp;is born on Miami, Florida,&amp;nbsp;United States.&amp;nbsp;Scroll below and check our most recent updates about Anya Taylor-Joy Height, Weight and Body Measurements.

Sweet corn (Zea mays) is a favourite treat for most animals, but the crop is particularly attractive to birds, raccoons, deer, squirrels, woodchucks, and insects such as the corn earworm, which feed on the plant.</description></item><item><title>Ash Creek Elementary School District 53 - Arizona</title><link>/ash-creek-elementary-school-district-53.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ash-creek-elementary-school-district-53.html</guid><description>You're on track to get doubled donations (and unlock a reward for the colleague who referred you).

We won’t be so hasty as to chalk Morbius‘ failure up to Jared Leto, as it was certainly a team effort (or lack thereof) from Sony, but there’s some exciting movies on the way from the conglomerate, so we’ll assume that Morbius will be the bad seed of the bunch and keep our hopes up.</description></item><item><title>Is 'Shadow &amp;amp; Bone's' Calahan Skogman Dating Anyone?

Sometimes they're pretty easy to get, like simply playing enough games,&amp;nbsp;or minutes in a season. Other times, it's reaching a certain stat milestone, such as number of sacks or kicking accuracy.
Reaching those levels gives an athlete extra cash in their pocket, so it's a big accomplishment if they get there.
