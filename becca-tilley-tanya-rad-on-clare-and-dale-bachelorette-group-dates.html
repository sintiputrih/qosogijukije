I feel a spark with Dale through the screen, so I can imagine what it’s like in real life.”</p><p>Tanya, who cohosts “Scrubbing In” with Becca, noted that she picked Dale, 32, out of the lineup for Clare, 39, before filming began in July.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Becca-Tilley-and-Tanya-Rad-Review-Week-Two-of-The-Bachelorette-Clare-Crawley-2.jpg><p>“I also feel like I felt the love at first sight with Dale,” the On Air With Ryan Seacrest radio cohost told Us. “Before they even started filming … I go, ‘This is Clare dude.’ Just by his photo.”</p><p>While Clare certainly has a connection with Dale based on the first two episodes of the season, the season 16 lead was visibly upset the contestants on her first group date — including the football-player-turned-model — didn’t seem eager enough to chat with her.</p><p></p><p>“I always remember [group dates] like going to take a breath and someone was stealing [him] and before we could even toast, you know, [the lead] was quickly taken from you,” Becca recalled on the podcast. “It was always a very quick thing. So, I kind of understood her feeling of like, ‘Where are y’all at, no one’s aggressively trying to have a conversation?’ And I also thought that she was a little bit upset that Dale didn’t immediately take advantage and grab her. I think that’s where the frustration came from. And she had to direct it towards all the men.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Tanya, however, thinks Clare should’ve played it cool.</p><p>“I kind of wish she would have just, like, chilled for a sec,” she said, noting that editing may have played a factor in the awkwardness. “I have no idea how that works. But just hang out with them all. Like, let’s play a game, let’s bust out some cards.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Becca-Tilley-and-Tanya-Rad-Review-Week-Two-of-The-Bachelorette-Clare-Crawley-3.jpg><p>The “Scrubbing In With Becca Tilley and Tanya Rad” podcast is up for<a href=#> Pop Podcast of 2020</a> at the upcoming People’s Choice Awards.
