She spoke seven languages and she took care of everybody like she was their mom,” Anderson shares. “And yet she was a bombshell, so it made her so interesting.”</p><p>Anderson believes Jennifer — the sitcom’s receptionist who was revered for having both beauty and brains — helped inspire the next generations. “Young women, especially, identified with [the idea that] you can be hot and also be the smartest person in the room,” she explains. “It was a wonderful thing.”</p><p>Anderson has an idea of where the character would be today. “I do think that she’s running the show somewhere,” she tells Us. “She is definitely a CEO, because she really ran the station.”</p><p>Next up for Anderson? Lifetime’s Ladies of the 80s: A Divas Christmas, in which she stars alongside fellow legends <strong>Morgan Fairchild</strong>, <strong>Linda Gray</strong>, <strong>Donna Mills</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Nicollette Sheriden</strong> </a>— all of whom play soap opera divas who reunite for a holiday special.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Loni-Anderson-Reveals-Where-She-Thinks-WKRP-in-Cincinnatis-Jennifer-Marlowe-Is-Now-2.jpg><p>According to Anderson, it was one project she couldn’t turn down. “When it was presented to me, [I said], ‘First of all, I want to be with these ladies’ and the script was so adorable — these five divas, what a great idea!” she shares. “I was on board immediately.”</p><p>Teaming up with the women was more play than work — “[There were] some laughs in the makeup and hair department,” she explains — and the group had a wonderful time going down memory lane.</p><p>“We were all talking about the old days. Linda explained to us how crazy it was in her life when the ‘Who shot J.R.?’ [phenomenon] happened,” she recalls of the Dallas star. “We learned backstage stuff that happened, because in that era, you had a secret and you had to carry it all the way through.”</p><p>Of course, the ladies also inquired about each other’s beauty secrets: “You can’t help but want to know [about] Donna — How do you stay looking like that? What is the deal? I know you have good genes, but wow, magic!”</p><p>Looking back on her career, Anderson knows what she hopes her legacy will be: “I hope that I’ll be remembered for changing the whole look of a young woman with a career.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My granddaughters are like, ‘What? Was it ever any different?’ Yes, it was,” she adds. “My daughter’s generation felt that they were able to do anything and still be cute — and my granddaughter’s generation doesn’t even think a thing of it.”</p><p>Ladies of the ‘80s: A Divas Christmas premieres on Lifetime Saturday, December 2, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOopplirq%2BwxKuqqKZdp7K3scClqmavmJq%2FpnnHnqlmr5unvW61zWaaoqaTnruvrdOiZJygkaeupMDEq2Siq12jvLh7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-jaehyuk-treasure-fans-left-enraged-over-concerning-fire-incident.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Jaehyuk?
