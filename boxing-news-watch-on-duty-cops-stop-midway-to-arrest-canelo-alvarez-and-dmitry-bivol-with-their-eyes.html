<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>WATCH: On-Duty Cops Stop Midway to Arrest Canelo Alvarez and Dmitry Bivol WithTheir Eyes</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>On May 7, last week, the Mexican boxer and 4-division world champion, Canelo Alvarez, went up against Russian fighter, Dmitry Bivol. They fought in the light-heavyweight division with Bivol’s WBA title at stake. A tightly packed T-Mobile Arena witnessed the fight between the two, and Bivol, exceeding everyone’s expectations, arose victorious in the end.</p><p>The Canelo Alvarez vs. Dmitry Bivol bout was a highly anticipated fight as it marked the sixty-first bout of Alvarez’s career and simultaneously carried hope for another Alvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin. Unsurprisingly, boxing fans greeted Alvarez with great expectations and awaited another night to embrace one more Alvarez victory.</p><p>Of course, Alvarez was returning to the colosseum on another Cinco de Mayo weekend and Mexican fans had to soak it all in. In a short video released by Bleacher Report, viewers witness three on-duty Mexican cops standing outside a pub and watching Canelo Alvarez take on Dmitry Bivol. Such was the craze of the event that even on-duty officials could not resist but stop in the midway of their service and devour the ongoing bout.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>&nbsp;An unfortunate day to be a Canelo Alvarez fan</h2><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Canelo Alvarez</a> and Bivol are both aged 31 years old and still in the prime of their lives. But Alvarez walked into the match with 57 professional wins, which is to say, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>three times</a> of what Bivol had won till then in his career.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story – <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Everything You Need to Know About Canelo Alvarez’s Golf Stints</a></strong></p><p>As expected, fans favored Canelo Alvarez heavily and cheered the Mexican to regain the light-heavyweight title he won from Kovalev in 2019. However, in a shocking turn of events, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Bivol</a> outclassed Alvarez and, by a vivid margin, defeated the latter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-05-08T051835Z_1359496364_MT1USATODAY18228360_RTRMADP_3_BOXING-CANELO-VS-BIVOL.jpeg><p>Canelo Alvarez drastically fell short, and throughout the twelve rounds, struggled to fight. Bivol took control and fought with excellence, leaving both Alvarez and his fans disappointed and utterly shocked.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Was the pressure too much for Alvarez?</h2><p>One could say so. As much as Alvarez fans strengthened the Mexican’s corner, they burdened the star with too many expectations at one time. The third match against Gennady Golovkin was almost scheduled by the promoters way ahead of the Bivol fight. In the meantime, UFC champion Kamaru Usman repeatedly called Alvarez out on <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Twitter</a> for a crossover fight against the phenom.</p><p>To add to it, YouTuber-turned-boxer-turned-promoter Jake Paul has also expressed his desire to fight Alvarez. Maybe it was the accumulation of all these factors that cost Alvarez the fight.</p><p>What do you think happened to Canelo Alvarez?
