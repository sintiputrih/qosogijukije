In the earliest culture of Mesopotamia, the <a href=#>Sumerian</a> civilization, women had more rights than under the cultures that came after it. As History on the Net <a href=#>describes</a>, women in Sumer could "own property, run businesses along with their husbands, become priestesses, scribes, physicians and act as judges and witnesses in courts."</p><p>The Sumerians even had a woman ruler at one point in their history. The Sumerian Kings List — a part historic, part fantastical, document compiling all the rulers of ancient Sumer — includes the reign of <a href=#>a lone woman</a> who ruled the city of Kish sometime around 2,500 BCE. Her name was Kubaba and <a href=#>not much is known</a> about her other than that she was a tavern keeper before she ruled over Kish. An ancient piece of propaganda <a href=#>describes</a> how the god Marduk took notice of her offering food and drink to men fishing for the god's meal and was so impressed that he "entrusted to Kubaba, the tavern-keeper, sovereignty over the whole world." Her reign was apparently popular, as she became a <a href=#>goddess</a> after her days of slinging ale and ruling cities were behind her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9mGtpcGlfrLWiwIyloJ%2BdXayutHnRnpilpKliuaq3xGadqKpdrLyusc1moKdlkaOwqrHNrWSmnaOkvbDAwKagmmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whole-foods-market.html><span>←</span><span>Heirloom Tomato &amp;amp; Avocado Salad</span></a>
