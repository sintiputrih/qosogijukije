<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Meet Roberto Hernandez! Bio, Age, Job, Father</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>TLC’s hit show I Love A Mama’s Boy is back for its 3rd season. In this season, we will see the addition of three new families, and one of them is Kristy Miera, Roberto Hernandez, and his overbearing mother Nancy.</p><p>In this article, we will first address the bigger elephant in the room, that is whether Kristy and Roberto are still married. We will also talk about Roberto’s age, job, and family later.</p><h3><strong>I Love A Mama’s Boy: Are Kristy Miera And Roberto Hernandez Still Married?</strong></h3><p>I Love A Mama’s Boy Season 3 features two returning families–Emily, Shekeb, and mother Laila; Matt, his girlfriend Brittany, and Mom Kelly–and two new families–Abby, Tre, and Mom Lorenda; Leyna, Ethan, and his mom Esther–besides the Hernandez family.</p><p>Roberto relies on his mom Nancy for pretty much everything–from getting his shoelace tied to being handed food. Roberto’s wife Kristy obviously isn’t happy with the way relationship between her husband and his mom.</p><p>In the trailer, Nancy was heard saying, “They tell me to cut the umbilical cord, I don’t know what that means.” The underlying tension between Kristy and her mother-in-law Nancy was more visible when Kristy angrily tells Roberto that he should have married his mother, to which Nancy rudely replies that he shouldn’t have married her in the first place.</p><p>Roberto and Nancy tied the wedding knots on February 7, 2017, as per their Facebook handle. The duo had two daughters as of this writing. They are Kristina and Kimberly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Roberto-Hernandez1-259x300.png><p>The adorable couple welcomed their first daughter, Kristina, on August 6, 2017. One year later, Roberto even shared a few pictures from Kristina’s 1st birthday celebration on his Facebook.</p><p>Roberto and Kristy had their second daughter in March 2019. Kristy took to Instagram on March 14, 2019, to announce the newest addition to their family. On April 22, 2020, Kristy shared via Instagram that Kimberly was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot, a heart defect, at the time of the birth. She further added that her child was undergoing open-heart surgery at the time.</p><p>While there is a clear sign of love and respect between Krity and Roberto, Roberto’s mom Nancy isn’t happy at all for them. Despite being a new addition to the show, she did not stop herself from going crazy in the show’s Season 3 premiere episode.</p><p>Roberto married his longtime girlfriend Kristy without inviting her to the wedding ceremony. Although Nancy likes to interpret the whole situation as Kristy stealing her son away from her, the real reason she was not invited was because of her dislike and disapproval of Kristy.</p><p>In her confessional, Nancy vowed she’ll make Kristy “pay the price” for stealing Roberto from her, and she did not waste any time acting on it. In the premiere episode, she questioned her grandaughter’s paternity and demanded a DNA test.</p><p>While Roberto was visiting his mother, he showed pictures of his two precious daughters. Upon seeing them, Nancy pointed out how while Roberto’s first daughter was a spitting image of him, his second daughter had no resemblance to her father. She even suggested her son get a DNA test to clear the confusion.</p><p>Several fans of the show took offense to Nancy’s words and slammed her on Twitter. “Forcing your son to take a paternity test of their daughter just cuz you don’t like their wife is clinically insane #iloveamamasboy,” one wrote. Another one wrote, “Oh Nah. Not mama Nancy get a DNA test for the child that doesn’t look like him. Kids can look like their mother and still be the dad’s child #ILoveAMamasBoy,” while also pointing out how genetics works.</p><p>Despite mama Nancy’s relentless efforts to bring Roberto and Kristy’s beautiful relationship down, the couple was still together as of June 2022. The two even shared a picture of them on Instagram in April 2022 with the caption, “O for One-Of-A-Kind because this is what Love feels like when I’m with her.”</p><h3><strong>Roberto Hernandez Age</strong></h3><p>Born in the year 1993, Roberto Hernandez’s age was 28 as of June 2022.</p><h3><strong>Roberto Hernandez Father</strong></h3><p>Although we know a lot about Roberto’s mother Nancy, his father is almost out of the scene.</p><p>His father’s name is Luis Valdovinos Sr. Roberto’s parents tied the knots in December 1993 and celebrated their 28th wedding anniversary in 2021.</p><p>To talk more about Roberto’s family, he has at least 5 siblings.
