The breakup came seven months after Aldean was spotted kissing <a href=#>American Idol</a> alum <a href=#><strong>Brittany Aldean</strong></a> (née Kerr).</p><p>Jason <a href=#>filed for divorce in April 2013</a>, the same day that Us Weekly confirmed their split. “This is a really tough time for my entire family,” the country star told Us in a statement at the time. “Jessica and I have been together since we were teenagers. We’ve been through a lot of ups and downs over the years as we grew up together as a couple. She will always be important to me because she is the mother of my children, and I know that we will both always make our daughters our No. 1 priority.”</p><p>The <a href=#>“Dirt Road Anthem” musician</a> moved on with Brittany, <a href=#>whom he later wed in March 2015</a>. “Today has been the best day of my life,” she told Us in a statement following <a href=#>the Mexico nuptials</a>. “I feel like the luckiest woman to have been able to marry my best friend.”</p><p>Jason and Brittany went on to welcome two children: son <a href=#>Memphis</a>, born in December 2017, and daughter <a href=#>Navy</a>, born in February 2019.</p><p>The <a href=#>“Big Green Tractor” singer</a> opened up to Us in January 2020 about <a href=#>raising four kids while making music</a>, revealing that he had “finally” figured out how to balance it all.</p><p>“Now I’ve made it a point at this point of my career to scale back a little bit and still make sure that I’m out playing shows and doing what I need to do there, but spending a little more time at home too,” he explained at the time. “I think it’s something that I’ve gotten a grip on a little, the older I’ve gotten and the longer I’ve been in the business. I think I’ve finally, after all these years, got it figured out now.”</p><p>Over the years, <a href=#>Brittany’s bond with Jason’s two oldest children has also grown</a>, becoming more like a sisterhood than a stepmom-stepchild relationship.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I really do find myself being kind of like a big sister, which is actually really fun,” the North Carolina native exclusively told Us in May 2020. “I do love the fact that they’re a little bit older because it’s so fun. I really am starting to relate to them, especially the older one. She’s going through things now that I can really relate to.”</p><p>Scroll down to see the sweetest moments between Jason’s blended family through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkt6K%2FzqdkmqSUmq6vv4ybo56mlJqxbrLApqClsV1peqy1w6xksKGknXq4tcWeZJuqmanBorrYZpyxZZqawLS1wppm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doja-cats-lime-green-2020-vmas-hair-how-to-details.html><span>←</span><span>Doja Cats Lime Green 2020 VMAs Hair How-To: Details</span></a>
