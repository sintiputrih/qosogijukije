But Us Weekly Stylish’s favorite look of the 24-year-old’s was the pastel green wig she wore to perform onstage in a skin-tight bodysuit that made the star look, well, naked.</p><p>Celebrity hairstylist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jared Henderson</a> chatted with Us to break down the steps for how he brought Doja Cat’s eye-catching hairdo to life. If you thought wearing a wig means a lot less work than styling one’s natural hair, the L.A. based hair expert’s about to change your mind.</p><p>“For the performance, we created a whole new planet that Doja lives on,” said Henderson. “So in essence she was a beautiful alien. We wanted to go pastel/lime green to compliment the colors in her outfit and the lights used on the set.”</p><p>To bring her outworldly hair to life, the first step was to dye the “Say So” singer’s long platinum blonde wig using Joico hair products. He filled a sink with hot water and then squeezed two tubes of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joico Color Intensity Semi-Permanent Hair Color</a> in the shade named “Limelight.” Then, like a witches brew, he used a large spoon to mix up the concoction until it turned green.</p><p>After that, Henderson dipped the wig in the water and let it sit for 20 minutes, before conditioning the hair with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joico Defy Damage Protective Conditioner</a> and let air dry. Finally, he let it air dry in preparation of the big event!</p><p>But that’s not all. A lot more work went into that hairstyle backstage before the star stepped onstage for her VMAs performance. Henderson said that he first “wet the hair down with spray bottle before applying <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joico Power Whip Firm Hold Design Foam Mousse</a> to mold the hair as I combed it back and away from the face.”</p><p>Then, he sprayed the hair with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joico Beach Shake Spray Texturizing Finisher </a>and scrunched it to add waves and texture to achieve the “wet beachy look.” After applying a “dime-size” amount of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joico Blonde Life Brilliant Glow Brightening Oil</a> in the pal of his hands, he ran it through the hair to “add a little shine and add to the wet effect of the hair.” Finally, he finished off the look with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joico Flip Turn Fast Dry Finishing Spray</a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling to check out behind-the-scenes pics from the wig-dyeing process — courtesy of Henderson himself!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvDqKGaZZOWwbR5y6KknmWXp7KmuoxrZ2toXau6or%2BMoZiiql2dvLh506hknZ2klratv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ash-creek-elementary-school-district-53.html><span>←</span><span>Ash Creek Elementary School District 53 - Arizona</span></a>
