She was born in New York City, New York to Cynthia Louise (née Bissett) and Joseph Germanotta, an internet entrepreneur. Descending from Italian and more distant French-Canadian roots, Gaga is the eldest of two children. She attended the Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21), a musical theatre training conservatory at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. Gaga withdrew at 19, deciding to focus on her musical career. After signing – and being dropped by – Def Jam, she signed with Interscope Records to release her debut album&nbsp;The Fame&nbsp;in 2008. With hits like “Just Dance” and “Poker Face,” she was a household name by the time her EP&nbsp;Fame Monster came out in 2009. This was followed by&nbsp;Born This Way&nbsp;(2011),&nbsp;Artpop&nbsp;(2013) and&nbsp;Joanne (2016). But even six Grammy Awards weren’t enough for the artist, who moved into acting and earned a Golden Globe for her role in&nbsp;American Horror Story: Hotel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Lady Gaga is known for her music and outrageous, attention-grabbing performances, as well as her avant-garde style of dressing herself.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Lady Gaga began dating&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Taylor Kinney</strong></a>, 35, in Dec. 2011 just a few months after&nbsp;they met on the set of Gaga’s ‘You and I’ music video in 2011.&nbsp;Gaga&nbsp;announced their engagement on Feb. 16, 2015 by&nbsp;posting a picture to Instagram with the caption: “He gave me his heart on Valentine’s Day, and I said YES!” It was announced in July 2016 that Taylor and Lady Gaga had broken off their engagement. However, the two remain close and continue to fuel romance rumors with their constant support of each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGianqSVl3ytrcOyZKCZl5Z8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-tommy-playboy-man-or-woman.html><span>←</span><span>Is Tommy Playboy Man Or Woman?
