Martin, executive director of Housing and Residential Engagement at CSUF. “The students that were here really appreciated the ability to live here.”</p><p>This year, the residence halls and most of the campus apartments will open to near full capacity. Some apartment buildings will be intentionally kept offline to accommodate COVID-19 isolation space as needed. Current planning predicts nearly 1,700 Titans will move in.</p><p>“What was so helpful last year is that people chose to live on campus, so they chose to follow along with the protocols,” Martin said. “That’s our hope for this year, that it will really be a partnership with the residents. We will have all these protocols in place to keep them safe. But we need them to be our partners in following them.”</p><p>A significant part of those protocols includes a COVID-19 vaccination requirement. In July, the CSU Office of the Chancellor announced that all CSU faculty, staff and students must provide proof of full immunization against COVID-19, or receive an approved exemption, before returning to campus. Those with an approved exemption will be required to participate in weekly testing. The deadline for full vaccination is Sept. 30.</p><p>Additionally, with COVID-19 cases on the rise fueled by the delta variant, CSUF is following direction from the U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control and the California Department of Public Health in requiring the use of masks in all indoor spaces, regardless of vaccination status. Subsequent guidelines outlined by both entities pertaining to self-screening, personal hygiene and cleaning practices are in place as well.</p><p>“We’re hopeful and planning for a more typical year, but we’ll see,” Martin said. “And we’re ready to support the residents and keep them safe as we continue to navigate variants, surges and cases.”</p><p>On the dining side, CSUF’s all-you-can-eat dining facility, The Gastronome, will once again be open for in-person service. Masks will be required for those not actively eating, but Titans will have a vibrant space to meet, gather, socialize and connect, an aspect of campus life that was missed last year.</p><p>The Community Market will serve students with its grab-and-go options, and the Late Night Café, the dining facility that opens after The Gastronome closes, also will return, with extended operating hours under consideration.</p><p>Returning to full operations has not been without its challenges. Martin said that due to limited housing available locally, CSUF’s on-campus housing waitlist is currently robust. The department is continuing to accommodate as many of those students as possible.</p><p>As with other food and dining establishments across the country, shortages in staffing and supply are resulting in a longer ramping-up phase for the return of the campus eateries. Patience from students as adjustments are made in the short term to meet these challenges will be needed, he said. For those looking for on-campus employment, positions in food service are available.</p><p>As the campus reopens, Martin is confident that his team is prepared to provide the highest levels of safety in housing and dining during the school year. Being forced to pivot in all areas over the last 18 months and having the experience of working through strict protocols will allow the department to be flexible, no matter what may come in the next months, he said.</p><p>This new academic year brings with it excitement and hope, and for many students, specifically, those who serve in leadership, this return signifies the first time they will meet face-to-face with their peers. Several campuswide events are being planned to help students re-engage, with health and safety remaining at the forefront. As Martin acknowledged, nothing can replace the sense of community that comes from being together.</p><p>“The theme we heard over and over last year is that folks missed being able to have an in-person college experience,” Martin said. “So, to be able to provide that … it just shows the power of connection, and we’re excited to be able to foster that and create those experiences once again.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk6jCp7%2BMnaarpaNirq%2BwjJ2gp6GenHqprculqmaqlZaxunnTqGSwnZyYvK6xjKyrrpyVo8G0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-medina.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Medina Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
