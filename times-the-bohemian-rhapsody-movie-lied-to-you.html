In the film, their relationship was depicted as much more strained — and much more separate — after their breakup, and that's just not the way it was. In fact Mercury continued to think of Austin as his "wife,"&nbsp;and was once quoted as saying,&nbsp;"All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary, but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary, and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9knBob3FfqbausdJmq6GdXZe8qbHMopinZaKdrrG%2Fzp2wZqWfq7amecuinJ1lpKR6urvUaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-rory-mcllroys-wife-a-depp-dive-into-the-life-and-career-of-erica-stoll.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Rory McIlroy's Wife?
