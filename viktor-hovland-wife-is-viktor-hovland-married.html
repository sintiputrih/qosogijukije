In 2014, Hovland won the Norwegian Amateur Golf Championship, the first of many titles he would collect.</p><p>In 2018, Hovland won the prestigious U.S. Amateur, becoming the first Norwegian player to do so. This achievement earned him invitations to the 2019 Masters Tournament, the 2019 U.S. Open, and the 2019 Open Championship. He played in the 2018 Emirates Australian Open as an amateur, finishing tied for 13th place.</p><p>Viktor Hovland’s performance at the 2019 Masters Tournament was exceptional, as he finished three under par, earning him the low amateur award and a tie for 32nd place. This performance also propelled him to the number one spot on the World Amateur Golf Ranking. At the 2019 U.S. Open, he finished in 12th place and was low amateur with a score of 280. This set a new record, as it was the lowest 72-hole score by an amateur in the U.S. Open, breaking the previous record set by Jack Nicklaus in 1960.</p><p>Following his impressive amateur career, Viktor Hovland turned professional after the 2019 U.S. Open, making his professional debut at the Travelers Championship in June. He secured a PGA Tour card for the 2019-20 season after finishing tied for second in the Albertsons Boise Open, part of the Korn Ferry Tour Finals. Hovland set a PGA Tour record for most consecutive rounds in the 60s with 19, lasting into the second round of the CJ Cup in South Korea.</p><p>In February 2020, Viktor Hovland became the first Norwegian to win on the PGA Tour when he won the Puerto Rico Open. He picked up his second and third PGA Tour wins at the 2020 and 2021 Mayakoba Golf Classic. In June 2021, Hovland became the first Norwegian to win on the European Tour when he won the BMW International Open.</p><p>In September 2021, Viktor Hovland played on the European team in the 2021 Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wisconsin. Although the U.S. team won 19-9, Hovland went 0-3-2 and tied his Sunday singles match against Collin Morikawa.</p><p>In November 2021, Hovland successfully defended his title at the World Wide Technology Championship at Mayakoba in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. He won by four strokes and set a tournament record of 23 under par. A month later, Hovland won the Hero World Challenge, finishing at 18 under par, one shot ahead of Scottie Scheffler. This win cemented his new nickname as the “Resort King” of golf, as his first 5 professional wins were outside of the Contiguous United States, 4 of which around the Caribbean Sea.</p><p>Hovland began the year 2022 with a strong start, finishing in the top five at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship on the European Tour in January. He then went on to win the Slync.io Dubai Desert Classic the following week, where he shot a final-round 66 and made a birdie on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff to defeat Richard Bland. This victory brought Hovland to number three in the Official World Golf Ranking, an impressive accomplishment for the young golfer.</p><p>Later in the year, in December 2022, Hovland once again found himself at the top of his game as he successfully defended his title at the Hero World Challenge. The event took place at Albany in the Bahamas, and Hovland’s win put him in an elite club of golfers who have won the tournament back-to-back, a feat previously accomplished only by Tiger Woods. Hovland’s victory was hard-fought, but he ultimately finished with a score of 15 under par, two shots ahead of second-place finisher Justin Thomas.</p><p>Hovland’s performance in these two tournaments is a testament to his skill and dedication as a golfer. With each victory, he has solidified his place as one of the top players in the world, and his continued success is sure to make him a force to be reckoned with in the years to come.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Viktor Hovland Wife: Is Viktor Hovland Married?</h2><p>As of 2022, Viktor Hovland was not known to be married.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq%2BgpKyfp3qpu9WlmKecXay2p7GMoqpmrpmgwbC%2BjKGmr6SRo7FuucCrqaKdlGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-shlafstein-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-153038-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sam Shlafstein Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
