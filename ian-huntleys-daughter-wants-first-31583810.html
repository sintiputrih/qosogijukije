I’m begging him to find the courage to finally tell the truth. I have asked to meet face to face so he can tell me in his own words.”</p><p>Aged 14, Samantha found out by accident that Huntley was her dad. Her mother Katie was 15 when she had a relationship with Huntley who was 23 at the time.</p><h3 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border publication-font brand-bg">Top news stories today</h3><p>She said: “I have been haunted by the death of Holly and Jessica. I’ve had counselling and it has affected everything from my jobs to relationships. I have suffered constant nightmares.</p><p>“People still stop me in the street and say, ‘Your father is a monster’ or ‘I know who your dad is’, so by meeting him I have nothing to lose. He has become a bogeyman, like the Yorkshire Ripper or Fred West. But you have to confront your demons.”</p><p>Huntley, who won’t be considered for release until 2042 at the earliest, resides in HMP Frankland, in Durham.</p><p><b><i>Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter <a rel=nofollow href=#>here.</a></i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCrnZOkv6V6wqhlrqNfo7K4v46uomavn6e5pXnNnq6sZ5mWu2601KerpZ2pqHqlrdSgn62domLEorrTrGSfoaKowW5%2FkG5vbHBhZQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./griffin-gluck.html><span>←</span><span>Griffin Gluck</span></a>
