This occurred during a tragic altercation that started as a physical altercation inside a fast food establishment when the woman apparently told her son to fire shots at a 32-year-old man.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Carlishia Hood, 35, and her teenage son are accused of first-degree murder in connection with the shooting death of Jeremy Brown on Sunday at a restaurant in West Pullman.</p><p>During a hearing on Thursday, Hood, who was also charged with a felony count of supporting a minor’s delinquency, was being detained on a $3 million D-bond; to be freed from custody, she must pay 10% of this amount.</p><p>She will show up in juvenile court alongside her son, who has been kept a secret.</p><h2><span id=Chicago_Video_And_Argument_Of_Jeremy_Brown8217s_Punch>Chicago: Video And Argument Of Jeremy Brown’s Punch</span></h2><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Chicago: Video And Argument Of Jeremy Brown’s Punch</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> What Happened Following Jeremy Brown’s Death And Obituary?</a></li></ul><p>On the internet and social media, a video of Jeremy Brown and Carlishia Hood yelling at one another is going viral. The event happened in Chicago’s Maxwell Street Express.</p><p>The guy and lady are originally seen in the video bickering before Jeremy abruptly starts striking the woman. The woman receives two punches, which leads to an event that spreads fear among the population.</p><p>The Chicago Police Department published footage of the event earlier this week to help identify the culprits, according to McCord Rodgers, who said that the whole incident was captured on camera.</p><p>According to the assistant state’s attorney, Hood and her son went to the Maxwell Street Express eatery in the 11600 block of South Halsted Street to buy dinner on Sunday night around 11 o’clock.</p><p>Hood allegedly argued with Brown inside the vehicle as her child stayed in it. Hood and Brown had never before spoken. According to McCord Rodgers, the dispute turned heated and physical when Brown began hitting Hood in the head at least three times.</p><p>The 14-year-old reportedly entered the restaurant during the physical struggle, grabbed a revolver out of his hoodie pocket, and shot Brown in the back.</p><p>McCord Rodgers claims that Hood told her son to murder Brown as the teen went after Brown and continued to shoot at him as he ran from the restaurant. Brown was hit twice before he succumbed to his injuries.</p><h2><span id=What_Happened_Following_Jeremy_Brown8217s_Death_And_Obituary>What Happened Following Jeremy Brown’s Death And Obituary?</span></h2><p>Over a terrible holiday weekend, more than a dozen individuals were shot and killed in Chicago. The Cook County Medical Examiner has verified his records. One of them was Jeremy Brown.</p><p>As was previously reported, Jeremy was slain following a fight with the kid’s mother by a 14-year-old boy, whose name has been kept a mystery.</p><p>Jeremy was first shot in the back by the child, but Jeremy survived, and he left the restaurant. The youngster responded to his mother’s command to pursue and murder Jeremy by killing him.</p><p>According to McCord Rodgers, Hood and her child then got back in their car and drove back to their house. They ultimately turned themselves into the police, and on Wednesday they were arrested.</p><p>Jeremy’s death has not yet been made public since the family is still in shock. The Brown family would cherish privacy at this time, thus the specifics of the family history are also kept a secret.</p><p>They would also want Jeremy to receive justice because he was shot and died while attempting to flee the restaurant following an argument that escalated into a violent struggle.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/simon-sinek-motivating-speech-on-wife-relationship/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Simon Sinek Motivating Speech On Wife, Relationship</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Television Personality</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Taylor Odlozil | Is The Tiktoker Alive | Husband Haley Odlozil</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>All About Neve O’Brien | Net Worth, Career</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfmLWqr8CgpmaumZmysHnAp5tmmaKcwq6xza1kmpqfqsFutsSrnKaxXZe%2FsMPNZqeuppOdeqWxwK2fZpmemXqwrsitrJqqqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-to-know-about-jonas-brothers-career-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>All To Know about Jonas Brothers; Career, Net Worth</span></a>
