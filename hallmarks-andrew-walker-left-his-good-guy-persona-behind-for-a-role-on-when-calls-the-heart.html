He has shown his ability to seamlessly embody the charming facade of Billy while skillfully revealing the darker motives lurking beneath the surface. As the series unfolded, it was revealed that he had only gone to the picturesque town after hearing about Elizabeth Thornton’s wealth.</p><p>While he smoothly played the part, Walker revealed that when he auditioned for the series, he was actually vying for the role of Jack Thornton. In an appearance on the&nbsp;“Hearties Hotline Podcast,”&nbsp;he was asked about the audition process for the role of Billy. He said, “‘When Calls the Heart’ was a really interesting situation because Daniel Lissing and I, we tested the mountie together … We did a chemistry read with Erin. He ended up getting the role.”</p><p>Walker went on to say that the show producer, Brian Bird, contacted him later and told him they would love to bring him on the show for a few episodes, and the actor was obviously down for it. He heard from them a few months later and was formally asked if he’d be interested in playing a character he no longer had to audition for.</p><p>Post source: <a href=#>The List</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tooJGhua6t0aSqZpmemb%2Bmw4ywmKWjlad6rbHFrWShoaNitLC7w2aerrFdpbKzv86nmGaalZ22r7CMn6arZZFiv7C4xGamp2WnnbKvecKao6WrXam1pnnHnpirrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./farhan-ali-agha.html><span>←</span><span>Farhan Ali Agha</span></a>
