Most of the time, the eliminated player would have something that represented them smashed once they were eliminated. These challenges have disappeared possibly because Jeff Probst doesn’t want the show to seem mean. However, this style of challenge needs to come back for two reasons. Most importantly, that kind of challenge had the potential to mix a season up as they exposed tribal hierarchy. On top of that, the items getting smashed when players were eliminated almost always was really satisfying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-paragraph-text-2024-06-17t095344-295.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaqVlrFww8eaq2ajmaOxbrvFZpqhmZyhsq%2BzxGabqJ2jYsC2vtWiraiqXaOyprCMraZmmqKeu6h5wZqapGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sunil-gavaskar.html><span>←</span><span>Sunil Gavaskar</span></a>
