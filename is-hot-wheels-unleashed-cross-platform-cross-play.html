Thanks to a patch that game long after the game’s launch, players on PlayStation, Xbox, and those using Hot Wheels Unleashed Windows Edition can all play together. Anyone using the Steam or Epic Game Store version of the title on PC cannot play with PlayStation, Xbox, or Windows Edition users.</p><h3>PC crossplay in Hot Wheels Unleashed, explained</h3><p>The developer explained that there are too many bugs and issues between other PC versions of the game and console versions, which is why crossplay was removed from Steam and the Epic Games Store for Hot Wheels Unleashed after one day of it being enabled, seemingly by accident. However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans have questioned the decision</a> because the Steam and Epic Game Store versions of Hot Wheels Unleashed launched at the same time as the console versions, whereas the Windows Edition only launched in July 2022, meaning most PC players already owned the game elsewhere at the time crossplay was implemented.</p><p data-injection=true>Matters are made more questionable by the fact that for that single day in July 2022, Steam and Epic Game Store players could use crossplay with consoles. A patch was then released that removed the ability for them to do this. Ultimately, this made fans think that crossplay was being used as a way to force PC players to buy the game again, generating more money. However, it could also be a legal issue between Valve and Epic Games and the other platform holders that’s preventing these versions from having crossplay.</p><h3>Does Hot Wheels Unleashed on Switch have crossplay?</h3><p>Nintendo Switch does not support crossplay with any other platforms. This may be a technical limitation more than anything else because this version of the game is running on the least powerful software of all versions. The game is also available on Amazon Luna, but we don’t have details on crossplay with that version at the time of writing.</p><h2>Is Hot Wheels Unleashed cross-platform?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20112333/Hot-Wheels-Unleashed-SpongeBob-Season-850x478.jpg><p>At the time of writing, Hot Wheels Unleashed supports crossplay, but not cross-platform progression outside of Xbox cloud saves between the Xbox and Windows Editions of the game. For example, if you own the game on PlayStation, you can’t carry that progress over to Nintendo Switch or PC. This may be changed in a future patch.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 7 Best Racing games on Nintendo Switch, ranked</a></p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/72721fa3ecb7cd425c8e9e789734b801?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Jamie Moorcroft-Sharp</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Jamie Moorcroft-Sharp is a Staff Writer at Gamepur.
