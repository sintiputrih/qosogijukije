Adele’s wildly lucrative, perpetually sold-out Las Vegas residency inside The Colosseum at Caesars Palace has seen the Grammy winner wearing scrumptious Valentino, Givenchy, and Schiaparelli designs onstage. Designer Michael Fausto never imagined that he'd be tapped as one of the legendary fashion houses to dress the star, but that's exactly what happened for Weekend 39 of the singer's hit show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August 2023, Fausto, who since launching his eponymous line in 2019 has worked with celebrities like Carrie Underwood and Allison Janney, received a cryptic note from stylist Jamie Mizrahi’s team about the possibility of designing a custom look for one of her clients, a roster that includes Adele, Jennifer Lawrence, and Riley Keough.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When I [eventually] saw the name Adele in the subject of their subsequent email, I was verklempt,” Fausto says. “Truthfully, as an emerging designer, I was a bit skeptical of the opportunity, given the prominent designers dressing her week after week.” So what compelled Mizrahi to think of Fausto? The otherworldly princess gown he created for Halle Bailey’s performance of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>“Part of Your World” on American Idol.</a> Fausto says, “They were [then] excited to connect.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Immediately, I began sketching designs and sourcing fabrics that would not only give the movement and drama needed for such a performance but also align with Adele’s personal style,” Fausto says of his creative process. “Having previously designed for televised productions and red carpets, from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Laverne Cox</a> at the SAG Awards to Real Housewives confessionals, I understand the high impact these pieces must express, as well as the needed functionality of the garment. Shortly after submitting my designs, I was informed of the styles they were interested in proceeding with.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fausto waited with bated breath for an update, and on Valentine’s Day of this year, he received confirmation that Adele would indeed wear his custom gown on February 16 and 17 for her residency.
