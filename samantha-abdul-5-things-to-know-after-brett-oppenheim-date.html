In December 2021, the Australian model, 41, confirmed that the twosome <a href=#>called it quits after less than one year together.</a></p><p>“Brett is my ex, but we remain very good friends,” the Sugar Taco restaurant owner wrote via her Instagram Story at the time.</p><p>Oppenheim, for his part, <a href=#>gushed about his ex following their split</a>. “Tina is the most genuine, loving [and] beautiful woman I could ever dreamed of with the most breathtaking smile. I will always love her and be her friend,” the Netflix personality captioned an Instagram post that same month.</p><p>He added: “I am grateful for you Tina. For your love, your laugh, your smile, and for our enduring friendship.”</p><p>Brett’s split came shortly after his twin brother, <a href=#><strong>Jason Oppenheim</strong></a>, pulled the plug on his relationship with <a href=#><strong>Chrishell Stause</strong></a>. “While Chrishell and I are no longer together, we remain best friends we will always love and support one another,” Jason, 45, wrote in a message posted via his Instagram Stories in December 2021. “She was the most amazing girlfriend I’ve ever had, and it was the happiest and most fulfilling relationship of my life.”</p><p>The former soap opera actress, 41, <a href=#>also addressed the breakup</a>, writing via Instagram, “I have tried to embrace the world I have found myself in and that includes being open and honest about my relationships. It felt scary and terrifying knowing that it may not end in what society deems a success and what I am ultimately looking for. But after many long heartfelt talks, I am choosing to see it as a success no matter what label is attached to it publicly,”</p><p>Stause, <a href=#>who has since started dating musician <strong>G Flip</strong></a>, noted that “men have the luxury of time that women don’t” when it came to having children, a <a href=#>milestone she and Jason didn’t agree on during their relationship.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“All of that being said, navigating this public terrain is difficult and I am just trying my best. No one would rather only speak about work related things more than me. But I understand this comes with it and I will always love and be extremely grateful for opportunities I have been given,” she concluded. “I very much hope to one day have a family and decisions I make at this point are with that goal in mind. Thank you for the kindness and support to those that understand.”</p><p>Scroll down for everything to know about Abdul and Brett:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKK5wKeroZldlq%2BlwctmbGasmJ67qL%2BMraZmo56kxG6txa2cq2WSp7K1wIyop6mdnp2yqrmMnZitnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lexi-randall-net-worth-68841.html><span>←</span><span>Lexi Randall Net Worth</span></a>
