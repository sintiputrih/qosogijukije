<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>WATCH: Rapper Drake gives a shoutout to emerging rapper and Streamer of the Year Kai Cenat during hi</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In a rather interesting turn of events, during a recent concert, <strong>Drake</strong> gave a shout-outto the famous streamer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Kai Cenat</strong></a> along with UK Drill King Central Cee. The trend of YouTubers and rappers started a while ago when Adin started inviting rap legends to entertain the audience. Kai Cenat, though having a major gaming background managed to get invited by Drake himself, eliciting a plethora of reactions online.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Kai Cenat is a world-class entertainer, with close to 5 million subscribers on YouTube. Though these numbers might not sound out of the world, Kai holds a vastly greater audience on <strong>Twitch</strong> and <strong>Rumble</strong>. He is well known for being seen with prominent streamers <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IShowspeed</a> </strong>and<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adin Ross</a></strong>. With dark humor jokes and charismatic behaviors, he stands out among all the other creators. Also, being a part of a famous YouTuber group, AMP, his value cannot be measured.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardi B responds to Offset cheating allegation during Kai Cent 24-hour livestream</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drake-shout-outs-kai-cenat-during-the-iaab-tour-concert>Drake shout outs Kai Cenat during the IAAB tour concert</h2><p>Interestingly, this isn’t the first time we have seen Kai at a music festival. Kai has his own music with NLE Choppa known as “Bust Down Rollie Avalanche,” and has performed it several times in front of a mass audience. He has a good taste in drill and pop music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kai.jpg><p>With that being said, Kai has a song with IShowspeed, namely “Who&nbsp;Let the Dogs Out”. We know that Kai loves to perform unusual and funny challenges with his friends to entertain his audience, but when freestyle rap comes in between, the numbers go through the roof.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>It’s such a proud moment for him and his fans, as no one expected to see a gamer standing between music legends. Nevertheless, Kai has made his way from a single room to playing games on a PC that costs more than a car. His hard work paid off when he finally won the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Streamer of the Year </a>Award. Kai has set an example that whatever you do in life, if you do it with pure passion and dedication, your dreams will become reality.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you missed it:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xKynqKqkqHqvsdasZKuZoKWys3nDq5iknV2ctrex0maYZquYpMK1u9StZK2nXZq6pr7GoqWgZaKWvbGx0WaYp5xdqMGzscCmnKtln5t6tbTEZrCemaJiuKK1jJycp5mkYrG2vsinnmagmah6pLvNnJyrrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roni-peiponen-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-496777-html.html><span>←</span><span>Roni Peiponen Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
