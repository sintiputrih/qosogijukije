His Bio, Net Worth, Wife, Height</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Michael-Pfaff.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Slipknot</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> have confirmed the identity of the “Tortilla Man.” Yes, he is indeed Michael Pfaff. After years of rumors and internet sleuthing, Michael finally announced to the world that he was the “Tortilla Man” v.i.a. a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) session on March 16, 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This “Michael Pfaff Bio” explores his life.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Meet Michael Pfaff aka The Tortilla Man On Slipknot</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>“You’ve been warned,” </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Slipknot</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> tweeted ahead of the Reddit AMA scheduled to reveal Michael. But there was one thing that immediately gave away that the revelation was going to be Michael — the percussionist pictured holding a piece of paper with the online event info and four words written over it, “I am Michael Pfaff.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So followed the Reddit AMA post. “Hello, Reddit. My name is Michael Pfaff. I’m the percussionist in Slipknot. Leg 1 of our US Headline Tour (3/16 – 4/17) kicks off tonight with In This Moment and Wage War,” Michael wrote.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Naturally, the thread was flooded with fans asking him a bunch of questions. To summarize, the revelation day was the moment when Michael felt like he was “no longer the new guy in the band.” Also, standing next to all the band members, Michael felt “pretty empowering.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Though it was a revelation, most of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Slipknot</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> already knew that it was Michael behind that “Tortilla Man” mask. “Michael pfaff tortilla confirmed finally, wish it was sooner bc it feels like Old old news now,” a fan wrote.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Michael and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Slipknot</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>‘s connection goes way back much further than 2019 (when he stepped into the band). Reportedly, he was first introduced by Sid Wilson to Clown in the 2000s, and together, they formed the alternative rock band called </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Dirty Little Rabbits </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>with Michael on keyboard and organ and Clown on drums.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fast forward to 2019, he got a phone call while he was working at his day job, and the next thing he knew he was a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Slipknot</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> band member.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span style=font-weight:400> Before the revelation, a few believed that the comedian/voice actor Gilbert Gottfried was the “Tortilla Man.”</span></p><h3><b>What Instrument Does Michael Pfaff Play On Slipknot?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Michael is a percussionist on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Slipknot</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. He replaced the long-time band member&nbsp; Chris Fehn in 2019.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But more than drums, Michael loves playing the piano. He’s been playing keys ever since he was young. Marimba/vibraphone/xylophone — he loves the combination of the two.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Michael does the back vocals as well.</span></p><h3><b>Michael Pfaff Net Worth</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Michael Pfaff garnered a net worth of under $1 million by 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meanwhile, his band member’s net worths then were — Paul Gray: $8 million, Shawn “Clown” Crahan: $10 million, Mick Thompson: $20 million, Corey Taylor: $15 million, Jim Root: $12 million, Joey Jordison: $6 million, and Craig Jones: $15 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before joining </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Slipknot</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, he was in a band called </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Dirty Little Rabbits</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, formed in 2007. The band members included — Shawn Crahan on drums, Jeff Karnowski on bass, Stella Katsoudas on vocals, Ryan Martin on guitars, and Michael on keyboards. They’ve released over 10 songs (all available on Spotify).</span></p><h3><b>Michael Pfaff Wife</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Michael Pfaff was keeping his identity secret all this time, let alone talk about his wife. So, her identity is a mystery to us.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, he did once mention her, talking about how hard it was to keep his identity secret when he joined </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Slipknot</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2019. “These days everybody is on the internet and has a phone. You could tell a person at the grocery store and the next thing you know it’s on the internet. I flew to LA twice before my wife even knew,” he shared.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Michael Pfaff?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Michael was born on April 4, 1973. That made him 48 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As per his birthday, Michael is of the Aries zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Michael Pfaff Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Michael Pfaff stands tall at a height of around 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He, Clown, and Jay are almost of the same height.</span></p><h3><b>Michael Pfaff Without Mask</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Michael is a white man with an oval face and a bald head. The face behind that mask is that of a lovely man, unlike the horrifying texture you see from outside.\</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>You might be surprised, but Michael’s mask is made from a mold of his head. Yes, the mask is turned inside out, with extra latex on it, and painted to look sick, with a zipper mouth.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, it was Jim Ojala who applied the fabrications to the mask.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, it was because of his terrifying mask, which looked similar to a tortilla, he was nicknamed “Tortilla Man” by fans.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Michael Pfaff From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Michael’s hometown was kept a secret.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Although we do not know where he hails from, we know for sure that its not Los Angeles, California.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>What Do We Know About Michael Pfaff Family?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Michael kept his private life away from this professional one.
