When Paltrow won her countersuit against Terry Sanderson — after he had accused her of crashing into and injuring him on a slope in 2016 — she was afforded a symbolic $1 judgment along with legal fees. Now, according <a href=#>to the Associated Press</a>, Utah district-court judge Kent Holmberg ruled in his final judgment that Sanderson will not have to pay Paltrow’s fees, per an agreement between both sides’ attorneys. The trial was surely an expensive one, the culmination of years of legal fighting featuring multiple <a href=#>expert witnesses</a> and <a href=#>equally expert animations</a> to boot. Sanderson’s lawyers even attempted to discredit Paltrow for the common practice of requesting attorneys’ fees. But in a possible compromise, Holmberg’s ruling also revealed that Sanderson’s team did not plan to appeal the case —&nbsp;dashing hopes of a sequel to <a href=#>the ski trial of the century</a>.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>ap news</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clfvp8olg00000ie6aawtx8q7@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Jury Sides With Gwyneth Paltrow in Ski Trial of the Century</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clfwsq88y00000ia9rdqjgl2d@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Goopiest Moments From Gwyneth Paltrow’s Trial</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Gwyneth Paltrow Is Really Getting Only $1 From Her Ski Trial</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdganyow9innK2gXaWurcDRqK5mq5ueerW%2ByJqjZqSVnK6tecWenKxmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-claybrook-40-29-news-bio-wiki-age-husband-salary-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Claybrook 40/29 News, Bio, Wiki, Age, Husband, Salary, Net Worth</span></a>
