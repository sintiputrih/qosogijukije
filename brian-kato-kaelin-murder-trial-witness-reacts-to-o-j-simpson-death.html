Simpson</strong></a>’s 1995 murder trials, released a statement in the wake of his death.</p><p>“I’ve been asked to comment on the death of O.J. Simpson,” Kaelin said via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Thursday, April 11. “Foremost, I’d like to express my condolences to the children, to Sydney and to Justin, to Jason and Arnelle, they lost their father, and that is never easy.”</p><p>He continued: “I wish to express my love and compassion to the Goldmans, to <strong>Fred</strong> and to <strong>Kim</strong>, I hope you find closure. And finally, to the family of the beautiful <strong>Nicole Brown Simpson</strong>, may we always cherish her memories. Nicole was a beacon of light that burned bright. May we never forget her.”</p><p>In 1994, Simpson’s ex-wife, Brown Simpson, and <strong>Ron Goldman</strong> (a close friend of Brown Simpson) were found stabbed to death outside of her Los Angeles home.</p><p>Kaelin was living in the Simpson’s guest house at the time and one of the <a href=#>prosecution’s key witnesses</a>. He alleged that he couldn’t account for Simpson’s whereabouts during the time of the murders.</p><p>After a low-speed Bronco chase through the city and highways in Los Angeles, Simpson was arrested and subsequently charged with the murders, for which he was acquitted.</p><p>Simpson was later found liable for the wrongful death of and battery against Ron in a civil suit filed by Ron’s family. Simpson was ordered to pay $33.5 million to the victims’ families.</p><p>News broke on Thursday that Simpson <a href=#>died at the age of 76</a> after a battle with cancer. “On April 10th, our father, Orenthal James Simpson, succumbed to his battle with cancer. He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren,” the Simpson family shared in a statement via X. “During this time of transition, his family asks that you please respect their wishes for privacy and grace.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After Simpson’s death was announced, Ron’s dad, Fred, <a href=#>broke his silence</a>, telling Us Weekly in a statement, “The only thing I have to say is that today is a further reminder of how long Ron has been gone and how long we have missed him. The only thing that is truly important today are the victims.”</p><p>In February, it was reported that Simpson was undergoing treatment for <a href=#>prostate cancer</a>, but he never publicly confirmed his diagnosis. After speculation began that Simpson was in hospice, he took to social media to <a href=#>deny the rumors</a>.</p><p>“Hospice? Hospice?! You talkin’ about hospice?” Simpson said in a video posted via X in February. “No, I’m not in any hospice. I don’t know who put that out there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmWu263wK2mZqORmrmquoymrKuclad6tb7ImqNmr5mpu6a%2F0mapnpmTqcBuwM5mpmaiXai2rrzSqKVmnJWWwal7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./weighted-blanket.html><span>←</span><span>Wrap Yourself in the Best Weighted Blankets for Great Sleep</span></a>
