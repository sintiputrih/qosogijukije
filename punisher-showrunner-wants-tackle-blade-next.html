Perhaps it’s because the Daywalker’s too dark a character to work on the big screen. Maybe he needs a gritty TV series, in the vein of say – oh, I don’t know –&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Punisher</a>.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>And wouldn’t you know it,&nbsp;The Punisher&nbsp;showrunner Steve Lightfoot has named Blade as the one other comic book property that he’d love to tackle after already helming the Netflix series featuring Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle. Lightfoot told Heroic Hollywood that he’s been a longtime fan of the anti-hero and would love to bring his passion for horror to the project.</p><p>“I have no idea who owns it, but I’ve always loved the Blade character. I think that would be a great one to come back with. I thought those movies were great and I love that mythology. I’m a big horror fan, and as a fan of that&nbsp;it would be a fun one to play around with.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Blade-Boss-Logic.jpg><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>In a first for the MCU, which usually just restarts a character from scratch, there’s been persistent talk of <a href=# rel=noopener>a new Blade following on from the old movies</a> and bringing back Snipes. In fact, the star himself <a href=# rel=noopener>has been teasing this for ages now</a>, with rumors pointing to him developing <a href=# rel=noopener>a project about Blade training up his daughter</a> as a vampire killer.</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=false>Again, though, nothing concrete has materialized just yet. As the MCU continues to expand though, we’re hopeful that&nbsp;<strong>Blade</strong>&nbsp;will return at some point in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yxwc2iqqGdomLAqbvWq6ynppWneritza2qZqyRmLitsYybo5qclWK7psTTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maxwell-whittington-cooper.html><span>←</span><span>Maxwell Whittington-Cooper</span></a>
