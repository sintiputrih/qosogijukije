However, amongst the all charmers, she had her eyes especially set on three boys — Dami, Jacques, and Davide.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Let’s get to know her better as this Chyna Mills Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Chyna Mills On Love Island</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The awaited Casa Amor plot is here. However, this time, the scene’s changed a little. Yes! just like the tradition before 2019, the ladies were sent to a second villa while the boys stayed in the original one.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Naturally, as the ladies joined the second villa, there awaited six brand new boys, all prepped up to build up a new relationship or even destroy the existing ones. But it wasn’t just the boys. They were also followed by six new girls to keep things “even.” And this is where our star Chyna Mills made her entrance.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After being single for 2 years, Chyna decided to revitalize her love life, and fortunately, she was accepted for the Casa Amor twist on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Island</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> 2022. So, prepping up to bring “confidence” and “good vibes”, Chyna joined the villa on July 1st ep.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I think I’m God’s gift and I’m overly confident, extra. If anything -Anyone that tells me I’m good looking, it just goes in my ears and fills my head up,” the star explained herself.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, she confessed that she was a “slow burner. “ It took a lot to win her over and people fell in love with them quicker than she did. “Hopefully, I won’t break any hearts,” she added.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, it’s a different story if the person falling in love with her was Dami (top priority), Jacques, or Davide.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>All excited for her fans to see what secret she holds, Chyna took it to her IG on June 3 to share, “The secret is out!! Our girl Chyna has entered the Love Island villa 2022! Keep your eyes peeled, it’s going to be a whirlwind. Thanks for the support so far and tune in tomorrow at 9 pm! #loveisland”</span></p><h3><b>Chyna Mills Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chyna Mills was 23 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Island</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She is the same as her Casa Amor twist female newbies Cheyanne Kerr, and Mollie Salmon. The oldest then, was Coco Lodge (at 27), and the youngest was Jazmine Nichol (21).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Chyna’s the same age as her male newbies Jack Keating, George Tasker, and Billy Brown.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span style=font-weight:400>Chyna wasn’t the only one eyeing Dami. The microbiologist from Dublin was also under the radar of Summer. “Dami is someone that I definitely feel like I have my eye on and definitely want to pursue the most out of all the boys. His dress sense is really good, he’s funny, he’s just like an all-rounder completely,” Summer explained.</span></p><h3><b>What Is Chyna Mills Ethnic Background?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chyna Mills flaunts “Black” ethnic background.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sadly, we don’t have much information about her heritage.</span></p><h3><b>Is Chyna Mills On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, as of July 2022, find Chyna on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>chymills_</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> with over 3.3K followers. Surprisingly, though she opened her account back in October 2019, she only had 10 posts at the time of writing this article. So, perhaps, she’s not much of a media person.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, she only had a video on her TikTok @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>chymills_</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, the last post from 2013 on Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>princess.chyna.35</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, and 121 followers on Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>chyna_mills</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Chyna Mills Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chyna Mills worked as a Youth Support Worker before she appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Island</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For those who don’t know, a youth support worker actively participates in community-based campaigns geared at bolstering support within young, vulnerable cohorts. They are also known as youth facilitators or youth care workers.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Requirements for being a Youth Support Worker include a High school diploma (which Chyna got from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Roundhay High School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>), and possession of applicable job-related qualifications such as knowledge about the most threatening social determinants of vulnerability.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>An average Youth Support Worker’s salary in the UK was around £25 (around $30) thousand per annum. So, this was probably what Chyna made as well.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Besides her daytime job, Chyna also cheekily mentioned that she worked at “Trey Songz Bed” over her FB.</span></p><h3><b>Chyna Mills Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chyna Mills stands tall at a height above 5 feet 6 inches (167 cm).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mentioning her district features, Chyna has dark hair, brown eyes, an oval face, and a fit body.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>When Is Chyna Mills Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chyna celebrates her birthday on November 24 and is of the Sagittarius zodiac.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Chyna Mills From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chyna hails from Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But she wasn’t the only Yorkshire lass who joined the Love Island 2022.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Who Are Chyna Mills Parents?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>The star didn’t reveal her parents.
