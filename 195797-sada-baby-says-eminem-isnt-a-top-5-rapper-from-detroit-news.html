Although the Motor City doesn't have a deep volume of rappers that have crossed over into mainstream fame, the talent pool is vast and includes some of the strongest names in the business. Most people's first thought when it comes to Detroit rap is Eminem, who has put the city on his back and elevated it by displaying it in his sound. According to Sada Baby though,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">nobody is actually bumping the legend's music</a> in his city though and he doesn't even&nbsp;make his Top 5 Dead or Alive.</p><p>Scott Legato/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">During a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">new interview with Say Cheese TV</a>, Sada Baby, who is one of the finest voices coming out of Detroit right now, laid out his Mount Rushmore of Motor City rap and from the start, he wanted to be clear that Eminem was not making it onto his list. When asked if Slim Shady is one of the best rappers from Detroit, Sada Baby said: "No. Out of Detroit? Hell nah. You talking about my Detroit?" He went on to critique the way that Em portrays the city in his music, noting that it's not entirely relatable to him or his homies.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I ain’t know we had trailer parks until I saw&nbsp;8 Mile. And I still don’t know nobody that know that n***a," said Sada about Eminem. "So it ain’t about being in the trenches, I’m just talking about as far as music and rappers and my Top 5 and my Mount Rushmore of Detroit rappers, Em is like an honorable mention. Just off the strength of&nbsp;8 Mile."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He goes on to list a few artists from the city that he really messes with, listing Blade Icewood, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Big Sean</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DeJ Loaf</a>, Tee Grizzley, himself and others that have shaken up the game.
