star's new husband explained to Architectural Digest&nbsp;in the video tour:&nbsp;&#34;So I bought this house about 16 years ago.

On the advice of Waldo, he stopped checking on the progress and put his trust in the designer, only seeing the finished result days before he moved in. It paid off, as he said: "I was floored!"</p><p id=eZj_6Ls3hJtg data-wc=61>The finished product is certainly impressive, with the home now boasting an entertainment room with a cement ping pong table, multiple closets, a home studio complete with a vocal booth, a movie theatre, a private outdoor swimming pool, a chic black and white kitchen with industrial lights, and a large dining room with seating for all of Travis and Kourtney's children.</p><p id=ezSAgLM57N6G data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Travis Barker & Kourtney Kardashian's $12million love nest is out of this world</a></strong></p><p id=eYzdpY9zIGBa data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a aria-label="10 celebrity brides who ditched tradition in short wedding dresses" class=hm-link href=#>10 celebrity brides who ditched tradition in short wedding dresses</a></strong></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><p style=text-align:center id=en7Bws8bo-xMT data-wc=8><strong>The Blink-182 drummer gave Architectural Digest a tour</strong></p><p id=eG7lv2iGD7OnD data-wc=39>While showing off the kitchen, Travis explained: "My aesthetic would be minimal." He added: "I don't like it when people put a bunch of things everywhere." That's certainly evident from the white walls, classic colour palette and clear surfaces.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNJB7vamOZ06k data-wc=14>While many of his fans flocked to praise his style, others weren't as keen.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=ebIwSYq1WcxuH data-wc=14><strong>Travis was pictured in his living room, which has doors onto the outdoor terrace</strong></p><p id=eA47wgVvb8U-K data-wc=60>"For being a minimalist house, it packs a lot of character and reflects his creative and calm vibe," one wrote, while another added: "This is actually a masterclass in how to design with black, keep it masculine but not overly masculine. It’s a great balance of keeping it feeling homey and not cold while still having a strong black palette."</p><p id=e3QTySnGTEF3J data-wc=32>Meanwhile, a third remarked: "I can't stand that these homes always look so sterile, a home should be lived in and look that way," and another described it as "cold" and "boring."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=eTyz7mtKYsNoP data-wc=10><strong>Kourtney shared snaps inside their open plan kitchen living room</strong></p><p id=ecGN_nMolUXBN data-wc=57>He's also added several personal finishing touches, such as a framed drawing from Penelope and a picture of his proposal to his now-wife. "Kourtney bought me these," he said, pointing to two chic stone-effect candle holders. "Way before we were together we would spoil each other and buy each other Christmas presents and birthday presents."
