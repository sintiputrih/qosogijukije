He has shared that he is not as confident as Rahim but has been hailed as an LGBTQ icon. Prior to the show, he played other gay characters. So, is he gay in real life?</p><p>Get to know him in this piece below.</p><h3><strong>Sami Outalbali Partner: Is He Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>Many die-hard fans of Sami Outalbali believe that Sami Outalbali is gay on and away from the screen. But there are others who believe that he only plays a gay role and is straight in real life.</p><p>One Fan wrote on Twitter, “This is the 3rd thing I’m watching where Sami Outalbali (the actor who plays Rahim in sex ed) plays a gay character I’m losing my mind ??”</p><p>They added, “I’m pretty sure he’s not gay (based on that video with the french YouTubers) but at the same time that’s so funny that man has never played a het character in his life.”</p><p>She is not the only one who thinks Sami is straight. One fan wrote, “Sami Outalbali, he only makes series and films where he is gay, he also made a gay magazine.” Another wrote, “It’s just roles, he’s straight I think.”</p><p>In S*x Education, Sami plays Rahim who dated Eric Effiong played by Ncuti Gatwa, and was in the center of a love triangle. The end of the show’s second season sees Eric choosing Adam Groff (Connor Swindells), his former bully, over his boyfriend Rahim.</p><p>Reddit users who are followers of S*x Education have voiced their disapproval of Rahim’s tale.</p><p>“Rahim did not deserve this,” one Redditor penned after finishing the season. “All the rage over Otis and Maeve still not being together, yet the real tragedy is Rahim’s heart being broken,” shared another. “He so did NOT deserve that. :(”</p><p>“Rahim was open, and frankly far more stable, confident, and mature, relative to Adam,” wrote a third. “There may be some issue in Eric’s life that will come in season 3 that Adam is utterly unequipped to handle emotionally. Hopefully, I’m wrong.”</p><p>With their observation that “Eric was into Adam more,” Screen Rant is on to something. In the end, the character showed more interest and attraction toward Adam than he did toward Rahim, his boyfriend. Additionally, Eric didn’t agree with Rahim on issues like religion or musicals and was embarrassed to introduce Rahim to his family.</p><p>It appears that they invented the Rahim character to facilitate the romance between Eric and Adam rather than determining which character would be a better match for the Eric character. Rahim was extremely underdeveloped—he didn’t even have a last name.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Sami Outalbali?</strong></h3><p>Born in March 1999, Sami Outalbali reached the age of 24 in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Sami Outalbali Parents</strong></h3><p>Sami Outalbali was allegedly born to parents of North African origins.
