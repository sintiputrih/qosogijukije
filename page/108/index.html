ShortcutsJeansDistressed denim is the height of chic, but if you can't be bothered to wear your jeans every day for a year without washing them, this could be the answerJapanese brand Zoo Jeans describes its product as "the only jeans on earth designed by dangerous animals". It may sound like the work of Zoolander designer Mugatu, but it is actually sort of true.

Power, Temperature, & Noise As expected given the NVIDIA-standardized GTX 1070 Ti clocks, the standard benchmarks for the GTX 1070 Ti FTW2 were rather humdrum in terms of raw performance, sticking closely to the reference Founders Edition card.
