<a href=../../will-deer-eat-my-corn-plants-html.html></a>
Answer
Deer will begin eating on and trampling down maize as soon as it is ready to be harvested. The plant will continue to develop until it reaches growth stage V5 as long as the growing point is not destroyed. Deer graze leaves from V6 till just before the tassel.
In a similar vein, you may wonder what creatures consume corn plants? Sweet corn (Zea mays) is a favourite treat for most animals, but the crop is particularly attractive to birds, raccoons, deer, squirrels, woodchucks, and insects such as the corn earworm, which feed on the plant.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ash Creek Elementary School District 53 - Arizona</h2><time>May 10, 2024</time>
