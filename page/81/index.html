See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It’s been so long
Feel my blood enraged
It’s just the fear of losing you

And I’ve been putting out fire

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Doug Ondler Obituary, Doug Ondler Has Passed Away</h2><time>May 31, 2024</time>
