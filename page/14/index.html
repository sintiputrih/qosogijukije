[Chorus]
My eyes bleed
I don’t cry no more
The pain that spills is tainted, filled with my sorrows
And when I speak
My words right my wrongs
I pray one day the pain will stay inside these songs
[Verse 1]
Know when we started, know when we met
That was the best day I had
Every day since back then
I can’t get you off my head
