<a href=../../every-upcoming-movie-in-sonys-spider-man-universe-explained.html></a>
After the complete travesty that was Morbius, Sony must be desperate to compete with Marvel’s slate of upcoming titles. While we’d argue that Sony have Marvel beat as far as animated movies and shows (Spider-Verse trilogy, hello?), it’s still safe to say that Marvel is the standout in all other areas, even if the MCU as a whole has left a bad taste in people’s mouths lately. We won’t be so hasty as to chalk Morbius‘ failure up to Jared Leto, as it was certainly a team effort (or lack thereof) from Sony, but there’s some exciting movies on the way from the conglomerate, so we’ll assume that Morbius will be the bad seed of the bunch and keep our hopes up.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is 'Shadow &amp;amp; Bone's' Calahan Skogman Dating Anyone?

Detective Pikachu is quickly building up hype as its May 10th release gets ever closer. Once a bit of an eyebrow-raiser due to casting Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu and having a faintly surreal sounding plot, the film has tested so well&nbsp;that Legendary’s&nbsp;already developing spinoffs&nbsp;in this new cinematic universe. Hardcore&nbsp;fans have also been kept happy through a very smart marketing campaign that has&nbsp;gradually revealed the movie’s takes on their favorite Pokémon with fans of the TCG set to be offered limited edition cards if they see the film on opening weekend.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Taylor Swift Predicted Her Life At 32 Ten Years Ago, Was She Right?</h2><time>Mar 13, 2024</time>
