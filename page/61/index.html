By default you don't need to supply a password to access the data, the key is just stored in the controller and everything is encrypted/decrypted on the fly. As with most SSDs with hardware encryption, if you set an ATA password you'll force the generation of a new key and that'll ensure no one gets access to your data.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Holiday Mia Kriegel - Bio, Age, Net Worth, In Relation, Facts</h2><time>Jul 1, 2024</time>
