The movie worked with Kendall Cooper Casting — New England, and in September 2021, the company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on Facebook</a> that they were looking for extras in Providence, R.I.</p><p>The Hocus Pocus production crew had to pay the town of Lincoln more than $25,000. They planned on using controlled fires and the historic Cranston Street Armory as a soundstage.</p><p>"The Cranston Street Armory is very spacious, it's got very high ceilings, it's open space ... because of its height, it gives an opportunity for a few of those witches to fly around," Steven Feinberg, executive director of the Rhode Island Film and Television Office, told WJAR.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston Globe</a>, an early screening for the film took place in the city of Warwick during a local "BeWitched and BeDazzled" festival. The showing was invitation-only, with over 4,000 tickets having been sold out within a month.</p><p>With spooky season and Rhode Island pride at the forefront, it's no wonder people want to see their hometown host the Sanderson sisters' shenanigans.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The first 'Hocus Pocus' movie was filmed in Salem, Mass.</h2><p>The first Hocus Pocus movie was filmed in Salem, Mass., well-known for its witch-based history. The movie is now a part of the area's culture. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Boston.com</a>, there was a Hocus Pocus-themed parade in 2018. Tons of people showed up wearing costumes and merch based on the movie.</p><p>In November 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Newport Daily News</a> reported that Washington Square stood in for a Salem-themed festival within the movie. Scenes were also filmed in other locations like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Hill</a>.</p><p>It may not be the same spooky filming location as its predecessors, but with the sequel finally out, fans will finally be able to see how the new film stacks up to the original in aesthetic!</p><p>Hocus Pocus 2 is now streaming on <a href=#>Disney Plus</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbykwdJmp6ibpah6c3nFoqOmoZ6ceq27wpqroqeeqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-jimmy-smitss-net-worth-in-2024.html><span>←</span><span>What is Jimmy Smits's Net Worth in 2024?</span></a>
