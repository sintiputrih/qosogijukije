It’s truly the only “complicated” relationship I have in my life, so I really shouldn’t be complaining, but so much of my confidence is connected to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>how lush and voluminous my locks</a> look that day. Bad hair days? Forget it. I really need to hype myself up when my hair looks, well, down, but I have some good news: <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">I found a product that lifts me</a> (and my hair) up — and not just a teeny-tiny bit. In fact, post-use, my hair looked so incredibly voluminous, my friend couldn’t believe it was all my real hair. “Your hair looks so voluminous,” she exclaimed. “I know, thanks,” I said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The secret? No, I didn’t get hundreds of dollars worth of extensions — that’s just not for me. I don’t like the feeling of having anything “fake” in my hair, meaning I prefer to go with the more temporary methods that still make a major difference — and said major difference was the famous, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sarah Jessica Parker</a>-praised <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Serge Normant Dream Big Instant Volumizing Spray</a>. I now refuse to leave the house without it, and when you try it, I have a feeling you’ll feel the same, too.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The volumizing spray, created by the mastermind Serge Normant, hairstylist to stars like SJP, and Julia Roberts, is at its core just that: a hydrating, volume-boosting, texture-enhancing mist that’s ideal for dry and thinning hair. That’s because its formula includes ultra-light <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">zeolite minerals</a>, a must-have ingredient for anyone with thin hair (me!), and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">white lupine protein</a> that infuses limp strands with major body and texture. Not to mention, the spray is actually lightweight on the hair; others I’ve used weigh down my roots, and by hour two, grease starts to build up. That’s why I’m so picky about the products I put in my hair. But I have zero issues with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the Normant spray</a>. All I’m left with post spritz-spritz is big, sexy hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Me and SJP aren’t the only fans. The spray was also used on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Meghan Markle for her iconic Time cover blowout</a>; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Brooke Shields’ perfect locks</a> were also coated with the Dream Big spray prior to a TV appearance back in 2022. Serge Normant is a mastermind (as are his products), and I could make one wish come true, it’s that he’d fly out to Italy and majorly level-up my wedding day hair. Hey, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a girl can dream</a> (big!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ready to see your hair go from flat to fabulous?
