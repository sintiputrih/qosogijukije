Age, Bio, Kids And Family Facts</strong></p><p>Amy Ward and her husband, American football coach Brandon Staley, have three children. Amy earned a bachelor’s degree in elementary education from Northern Illinois University in 2007 after graduating from Sycamore High School in 2004. Mrs. Stanley worked as a first-grade teacher in Hutchinson, Kansas.</p><p>Brandon, her husband, is the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers in the National Football League (NFL). Prior to 2020, he was the defensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Rams and an assistant coach for the Chicago Bears and Denver Broncos.</p><p>From 2006 to 2008, the Los Angeles coach worked as a graduate assistant at Northern Illinois before taking over as defensive line and special teams coach at the University of St. Thomas in 2009.</p><p>From 2003 to 2004, he was a two-year starter at quarterback for the University of Dayton Flyers, serving as team captain and contributing to the team’s 16-5 record. He played his final game at Mercyhurst College with his twin brother Jason in 2005.</p><p>Similarly, he was named head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers on January 17, 2021. On September 12, 2021, he made his regular-season coaching debut against Washington, which the Chargers won 20-16.</p><p>Staley led the Chargers to a 9-7 record through the first 16 games of the season. However, in Week 18’s must-win game against the Las Vegas Raiders, Staley was chastised for two of his game-time decisions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brandon-Staley-300x300.jpg><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who Is Bradly Rogers Husband of Dani Welniak?

She earned a bachelor’s degree in elementary education from Northern Illinois University in 2007 after graduating from Sycamore High School in 2004. Mrs. Stanley was a first-grade teacher in Hutchinson, Kansas. She is Amy Ward’s proud sister and the daughter of John and Deborah Ward.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Stanley_Is_Also_A_Sports_Devotee_Like_Her_Husband></span>Stanley Is Also A Sports Devotee Like Her Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amy was always drawn to sports as a child on various levels. She remarked in a podcast that sports were an important part of her life and had a huge influence on her. Amy’s mother taught physical education in her hometown, and she played volleyball in high school.</p><p>Amy spent her high school years living the “club volleyball life,” hoping to acquire opportunities to play in college. She deliberately spent ten months of each year to playing volleyball, studying hard to be a good student, and participating in extracurricular activities in order to get a full-ride scholarship.</p><p>After her senior year of high school finished in December, she began spring practice with the NIU volleyball team in preparation for the fall of her freshman year on the varsity squad.</p><p>Even Staley’s wife received a scholarship for her collegiate volleyball skills. During the interview, she admitted that her parents had made considerable financial and time commitments to support her volleyball career. Amy always made an effort to honor her parents when participating in sports as a child.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Los_Angeles_Chargers_Head_Coach_Wife_Amy_Is_Currently_37_Years_Old></span>Los Angeles Chargers Head Coach Wife Amy Is Currently 37 Years Old<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amy Staley, Brandon Staley’s wife, is 37 years old. Her parents, John and Deborah Ward, gave birth to her on October 31, 1985, in Sycamore, Illinois. Joshua Ward is her younger brother.</p><p>Because her mother was a physical education teacher, she participated in as many activities as she could, including camp, soccer, softball, and volleyball. Amy stated that she began playing club and travel volleyball in sixth school. However, because she grew up in Sycamore, she spent every summer collecting and selling sweet corn for her high school volleyball coach.</p><p>Amy, on the other hand, was unable to continue playing volleyball owing to bilateral foot pain. She began focusing on her studies to become a teacher while also helping the NIU Athletic Department by staffing the front desk of the newly completed Yordon Center.</p><p>Brandon, her husband, is also 39 years old. As a result, the pair has a two-year age difference. Brandon chose to play quarterback for the University of Dayton after preferring basketball than football in high school. He went on to play for Mercyhurst College, where Jason was finishing up his degree after graduating from Dayton with a journalism degree.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brandon_And_Amy_Kids_And_Family_Facts></span>Brandon And Amy Kids And Family Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brandon and Amy Staley have been married for 11 years and have three sons: Colin, Will, and Grant.</p><p>The parents and children enjoy a wonderful, caring relationship. Amy’s Facebook profile shows that the family is satisfied with their lifestyle of living near the beaches of Los Angeles. Amy Staley’s children were also present on the day of Brandon’s appointment.</p><p>The family currently resides in Thousand Oaks, California, with their three sons. As a stay-at-home mother, Amy now promotes reading in the neighborhood, a subject that is important to her.</p><p>The Staleys have dealt with the logistical challenges that come with being a football family by remaining focused on their key priorities. Brandon’s wife’s major focus remains on their children, despite the fact that Brandon’s position as head coach frequently necessitates him to be away from home.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>NHRA Racer Antron Brown Came Into The Spotlight Following His Testimony Regarding The Dangers Involved In Motorsports</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Amy_And_Brandon_Have_Been_Together_For_11_Years_Now></span>Amy And Brandon Have Been Together For 11 Years Now<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On June 25, 2011, Brandon Staley and his wife Amy exchanged vows at St. Cyprian Church in Perry, Ohio. They have three amazing sons since then: Colin, Will, and Grant.</p><p>Amy met Brandon Staley, a graduate assistant football coach at NIU, just two months before she finished her education degree. Even though they were both in their early twenties in 2007, she could tell Brandon was a man with a plan. After years of courtship, the couple married.</p><p>Amy was a teacher before she married. Amy began her career as a first-grade teacher in Hutchinson, Kansas. She has taught in six districts, five states, and seven schools since then.</p><p>Amy claimed that she remembers every pupil she has ever taught. She had a great experience working as a teacher and misses it now and then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brandon-Staleys-Wife-And-Kids-300x300.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quick_Facts></span>Quick Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table" style=width:65.4545%;height:259px><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Amy Ward</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>37 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Parents</strong></td><td>John and Deborah Ward</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sibling</strong></td><td>Joshua Ward</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Husband</strong></td><td>Brandon Staley</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>Colin, Will and Grant Staley</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Some_FAQs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=m-0><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Brandon_Staley_Wife_Amy_Ward-2></span>Who Is Brandon Staley Wife Amy Ward?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Brandon’s wife Amy is a graduate student.
