I guess that's the reason, but am I the only one criticizing the content in his movies?"</p><p>The two had an awkward encounter on an airplane and avoided one another, but continued to cast shade behind the scenes. In 2015, Sandler admitted to Stern that his feelings were deeply hurt by his commentary, and he explained that the bad reviews had an impact on him at the time. "When I was at NYU freshman year, I loved you. That's why it was weird when you used to slam me. It would break my heart because I loved you growing up," Sandler said.</p><p>Stern remorsefully responded, "I always felt bad about all the years we didn't speak, I really did, because I was a total f***ing a**hole."
