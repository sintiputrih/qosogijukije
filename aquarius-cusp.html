This month, our focus is on those born on the <b>Aquarius Pisces</b> Cusp.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-zodiac-sign-is-the-stupidest></span>Which zodiac sign is the stupidest?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Because Pisces is the most suggestible of all the <b>signs</b>. What that means, Pisces, is that you are perceived as one of the <b>dumbest signs</b> of the <b>zodiac</b>, the “go-to schmuck” for gags, pranks and teases.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-aquarius-pisces-cusp-compatible-with></span>Who are Aquarius Pisces cusp compatible with?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>Aquarius</b>–<b>Pisces</b> individuals have a much wider range of <b>compatibility</b> because they can work well with air and water signs. And they can complement fire and earth signs. If they happen to lead with <b>Aquarius</b>, they will favor the air and fire sign connections (Libra, Gemini, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-aquarius-pisces-cusp-intelligent></span>Are Aquarius Pisces cusp intelligent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>Aquarius</b>–<b>Pisces</b> woman comes along with a double influence, part of it being the pacifistic and idealistic personality of the <b>Pisces</b>, the other the unconventional, <b>intellectual</b> and eclectic spirit of the <b>Aquarius</b>. The result is unfathomable, in that there’s really nothing good enough to measure her potential.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-aquarius-pisces-cusp-emotional></span>Are Aquarius Pisces cusp emotional?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>Aquarius</b>–<b>Pisces cusp</b> man is <b>sensitive</b> and <b>emotional</b>. Unconventional and eccentric, this man is very creative and imaginative, but also a master procrastinator. In general, he’s someone who likes to talk to people.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-aquarius-pisces-cusp-called></span>What is the Aquarius Pisces cusp called?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>Aquarius Pisces cusp</b> is known as the ‘<b>Cusp</b> of Sensitivity’.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-cusp-signs-better></span>Are cusp signs better?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>When your birthday falls between two zodiac <b>signs</b>, it’s known as being born on the <b>cusp</b>. It might feel like an identity crisis, not knowing whether you’re one sign or the other, but in fact you have the <b>best</b> of both worlds.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-january-aquarius-better-than-february-aquarius></span>Are January Aquarius better than February Aquarius?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Originally Answered: Is a <b>January aquarius</b> different <b>than</b> a <b>February aquarius</b>? In a general sense, no. But, there are aspects to the Sun. Aspects are harmonious, i.e. trine 120 degrees, 60 degrees, sextile, and hard aspects, such as squares, 90 degrees, or 180 degrees, opposition (the most aggravating one of all).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-february-19th-a-aquarius></span>Is February 19th a Aquarius?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The cusp between <b>Aquarius</b> and Pisces happens at a precise moment, which varies from year to year. If you were born before it you would be <b>Aquarius</b>, and after it you would be Pisces. It’s not as simple as saying <b>February</b> 18th is always <b>Aquarius</b> and <b>February 19th</b> is always Pisces.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-pisces-good-with-aquarius></span>Is Pisces good with Aquarius?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Pisces</b> and <b>Aquarius</b> Compatibility. <b>Pisces Aquarius</b> is sometimes a bad match. It can be hard for each of you to get what you want, much less what you need from this partnership.

Since the <b>Pisces</b> is dreamy, loving, and peace-seeking, they will find completion in a <b>soulmate</b> with the Taurus zodiac. Taurus can be the romantic partner of a <b>Pisces</b>. Taurus is practical, romantic, loving, and can be the best friend to a <b>Pisces</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-it-mean-to-be-born-on-february-20></span>What does it mean to be born on February 20?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>IF YOUR <b>BIRTHDAY</b> IS <b>FEBRUARY 20</b>, you are unpretentious. If you are wondering what zodiac sign is <b>February 20</b>, then, of course, it is Pisces. Your gentle and affectionate nature <b>makes</b> you a kind person. Pisces <b>born on February 20</b>, you have this way of making anyone feel good about themselves.
