In 1989, he was shot to death, along with his wife Kitty, by his children, Lyle and Erik, inside their Beverly Hills mansion, reports .

The band was created by Edgardo Díaz and consisted of around 40 members in its group over the decades it was active, including Ricky Martin.

He said in the documentary, “All I remember was that I, like, passed out. When I woke up, I was naked and I was bleeding, so I knew that I had been penetrated. I had, like, these burn marks on my face from the rug … I was very confused and I didn’t understand." He also added, "During my time in Menudo, I was raped a series of times, and that was the way that predators would take advantage of me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonahiuqa61J2mZqWVoq%2BmvoyrprJloqTAtLHLpaZmmZyhsqix0mahqKuVYrqmusSnm56yXaeusbHDZp%2BipQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-play-the-druid-class-in-dungeons-dragons-5e.html><span>←</span><span>How To Play The Druid Class In Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons 5E</span></a>
