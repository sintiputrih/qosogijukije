But just how lucky were they?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Almost two years after their sudden divorce, reports claimed that while Kris certainly wanted to propose and get married to Kim, his plans didn’t include the involvement of a camera crew filming every moment of the big reveal for the sake of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the show’s ratings</a>.</p><p>During their divorce deposition, it was revealed how certain scenes had been staged, such as Kris Humphries getting on one knee and popping the question to Kim - apparently, he was instructed to do this twice because Kim didn’t like the reaction the first time around.</p><p>But aside from reshooting the proposal, Kris also took an issue with producers telling him to pop the question in Los Angeles when he planned to propose in Minnesota. Here's the lowdown.</p><h2 id=kuwtk-is-scripted>‘KUWTK’ Is Scripted</h2><p>This shouldn’t be a shocker, but in case fans were still wondering, Keeping Up With the Kardashians is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">definitely scripted</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That’s not to say that the show doesn’t offer some form of reality here and there, but in February 2013, TV producer Russell Jay admitted that some things are orchestrated for entertainment purposes.</p><p>While Russell wouldn’t go into detail on all the scripted moments, he confessed that there were at least two scenes involving Kris Humphries that had been scripted, edited and reshot for the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These ‘KUWTK’ Storylines Would’ve Been Boring Without Kourtney Kardashian</a></span></p><p>He further revealed that Kim was well aware of the proposal because the big reveal had to be reshot because she didn’t think her reaction was good enough on camera.</p><p>It should be noted that reality shows are commonly reshooting scenes when the camera crew happens to miss key moments that tell an important narrative, but the fact that Kim knew about the proposal and decided to reshoot the scene seemed redundant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-arranged-the-proposal>Kim Arranged The Proposal</h2><p>If fans thought that Kris had any major involvement in his proposal to Kim, think again. Sources told Radar Online how the mother-of-four orchestrated everything - she wasn’t surprised by any of it because she, along with the show’s producers, were the ones who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">put it all together</a>.</p><p>“Kim told Kris how, where and when to propose, it was absolutely no surprise to her whatsoever,” the insider notes.</p><p>It was also mentioned how Kim allegedly chose a particular time of the day when the daytime lighting would be at its best in sunny LA while wearing a full face of makeup before serving up her best acting skills with her surprise reaction.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KUWTK: Every Kardashian Spinoff And Where To Watch Them</a></span></p><p>“First of all, Kris proposed in the middle of the day, and he had to do that because it would create better lighting to capture the moment. Kim looked so surprised but she knew it was happening.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kris, on the other hand, wanted a minimal romantic moment set in Minnesota, which Kim immediately shut down, according to the publication.</p><h2 id=kris-wanted-to-save-the-marriage>Kris Wanted To Save The Marriage</h2><p>When Kim filed for divorce from Kris Humphries in October 2011, it was the NBA player who came forward with a statement insisting how determined he was to keep his marriage together, completely oblivious at the time that his ex-wife was ready to move on from the relationship.</p><p>"I'm committed to this marriage and everything this covenant represents,” the NBA player said, insisting that he would do whatever it takes to make things right with Kim. “I love my wife and am devastated to learn she filed for divorce.”</p><p>Unfortunately for him, Kardashian showed little to no interest in the idea of calling off the divorce, especially after having already admitted to feeling disconnected from her ex-husband during their 72-day marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-felt-pressured-to-get-married>Kim Felt Pressured To Get Married</h2><p>Six years after their divorce, Kim Kardashian sat down for an interview on Andy Cohen’s Watch What Happens Live, where she opened up about the pressure she felt since all of her friends were getting married and having children.</p><p>While it might have been a reckless decision of hers, Kim decided she also wanted to settle down, and when she started <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating Kris</a>, the KKW founder wasted no time to walk down the aisle with him, convinced at the time that they would spend the rest of their lives together. Yikes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Kanye West Tweets That Are More Entertaining Than An Episode Of KUWTK</a></span></p><p>“I just thought, 'Holy s**t, I'm 30 years old, I better get this together, I better get married,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim explained</a>.</p><p>“I think a lot of girls do go through that where they freak out thinking they're getting old and have to figure it out, all their friends are having kids.
