During the Middle Ages, many people also saw mandrakes as good luck charms and carried them around to ward off ill fortune, according to Wired.</p><p dir=ltr>The mandrake is also shrouded in a variety of mysterious and macabre legends, including the myth that mandrakes, when pulled up from the ground, could emit a scream so loud it could kill whoever digs it up. According to <a href=#>Atlas Obscura</a>, this myth may have been invented by <a href=#>medieval witches</a> who wanted to discourage people from uprooting the plant, which they often used in potions, charms, and healing concoctions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCClmxscWtfqbWmedGemKVlnJ6zpnnPpZinrF2ptaLAjKKlrKiZp7KledOhnGalkaOxs63KnqpmoZ5itaK%2B0bJkqaekqbKzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natanael-cano-corridos-tumbados-lyrics-english-translation.html><span>←</span><span>Natanael Cano Corridos Tumbados Lyrics English Translation</span></a>
