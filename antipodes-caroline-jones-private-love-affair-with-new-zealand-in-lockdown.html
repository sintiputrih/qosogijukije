This included a recording with Hamilton-based The Trenwiths, over the cliffs at Raglan.</p><p>However Jones says she has a long list of all-time favourite New Zealand bands, she'd love to go on the road with:</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-travel">Related articles</h2><p>"Mild Orange; I love their sonic sensibilities. Of course, Neil Finn! We also went to a Th'Dudes concert and really fell in love with their new album."</p><p>The wide open skies and countryside of the Land of the Long White Cloud has some obvious similarities to the US and folk music scene. However it's the people and the stories of New Zealand rather than the landscape which Jones feels have the most county roots:</p><p>"I find many parallels between New Zealand culture and country music culture. American country music is rooted in the authentic life experience of working class people," she said.</p><p>"They are the salt of the earth, much like I find Kiwis to be."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmraqRq7Kte8Cnq6Kon5mytHnCmqmopJmjsm62zqecrGWgp7a3rdOeZKWnppp6orLFmqCrZaeewal5zZ6uZrKVlrmiusNmoKdlnKSwrLDOsKVoh31qkJqip41ue257do6NgLZrj4VvgH6nipmO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wolfgang-van-halen-confirms-death-father-eddie-van-halen.html><span>←</span><span>Wolfgang Van Halen Confirms The Death Of His Legendary Guitarist Father, Eddie Van Halen</span></a>
