Seriously, how can you be under the impression that practically anyone who was alive in the '90s never touched a Mega Man game? And I think Zeta has a right to call Nights over-rated. I never played it myself, but nonetheless, I see people hyping about it, several of whom believe it's the sole reason to own a Saturn (though, I can name a shitload of other games which interest me, personally.... I need to get around to buying a Saturn). I'm not saying the game looks bad, that I'm turned off from playing it due to all the fanboys, but I am saying there's a fair chance it won't live up to the expectations I kept hearing whenever I do get around to finally playing it. Assuming Zeta did play Nights, he could have had the same impression. Remember, "underrated" can hardly mean a game is outright bad (though, it sure as hell seems to be thrown around the internet a lot in such a context). It simply means it's hyped up to be more than it actually is.<p>Jade Cocoon. Not 2, though. 2 was lacking, and the monsters were awfully Pokemon-ish.</p><br>YOU WILL DIE FOR THAT COMMENT!!! [cough] Um.... I mean..... uh.... whatever, just an opinion, right? I'm... just gonna go about my merry way.... or something... yeah.<p>In all seriousness, I prefer having established things in my game than complete and total customization (especially when the fusions can end up looking like shit -_-). I also think Jade Cocoon 2 deserves MAJOR points for using such a unique battle system, one the likes of which has never been seen in other monster-raisers, nay RPGs in general. Plus, unlike Jade Cocoon 1, it didn't have that shitty movement control which I hear actually plagued several early PS1 titles.</p><p>U kidding? Link's Awakening is heavily ignored compared to the other games.</p><br>actually, so far as I'm concerned, it's among the most critically-acclaimed games from the 8-bit portable era (as expected of a Zelda title). The only reason it's ignored now is because it's never seen anything like a remake or a release on a Collector's Disc or the Wii (why the hell won't Nintendo provide downloads of Game Boy games?)... not counting Link's Awakening DX, which still stands as a relic from two generations ago, the days when Nintendo still used cartridged-based consoles and battery back-up.<p>Anyway, I just wanted to throw this out here: while NIS America seems to have been doing a good job getting their name out there (much more than Atlus ever did), and their games tend to get pretty good reviews, they tend to be listed with some rather unfair "flaws". In particular, I've noticed several of the major reviewers getting on Atelier Iris for using "dated graphics". What a bunch of assholes. Can't they see that those sprites are pretty damn high-quality, something that one couldn't dream of accomplishing with the SNES, or possibly even the 32-bit generation (well.... Atelier Iris might be possible on there.... Odin Sphere on the other hand)? 2D is a genre all its own, and it too is still capable of progression. However, the mainstream media's just gotta be a bunch of dicks who believe it should die off and let everything be in 3D, and that really makes me sad.</p><p>You know, I really gotta commend the Japanese adult gaming industry.... not just because I like hentai, but because they prove there's not so damn much of an emphasis on 3D over there as there is here. I mean, text adventures.... aside from the rare localized hentai, we don't even fucking get that genre over here. Mind you, I have yet to play a text adventure for myself, but I sure am interested in experiencing whatever story's being constructed behind that beautiful CG art (and yes, I have heard it's just a cheap excuse for fap fodder in most cases, but some of these stories are highly praised as well.... Key and Type-Moon games, for instance. That and, OMG, there're some text-adventures that actually aren't ero, some of which you may recognize being mentioned on Smash Bros. Melee trophies). Being made aware of the hoard of 2D RPGs and other such games being made by doujin circles also gives me a warm feeling deep inside. ^^</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHywwsSrqZqslZl6trrDnqmrmaSasW6zwKacrGZiaYF3g44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miguel-pimentel.html><span>←</span><span>Miguel Pimentel Age, Career, Height, Net Worth, Nationality, Facts</span></a>
