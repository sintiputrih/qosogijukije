She maintains her sophisticated status on the Atlanta social scene by making time for her daily fitness regimen. Moreover, Whitfield juggles her hectic schedule, fashion line, and family life with her three children, <strong>Kairo, Kaleigh, </strong>and<strong> Tierra,</strong> with ease.</p><p>Sheree has been a cast member on The Real Housewives of Atlanta since the show’s inception in 2008. She was a regular cast member on the show for four seasons before leaving. However, she returned to the show four years later as a friend for season 8, was promoted to a full-time position for two years, seasons 9 & 10, and then left for the second time. Similarly, her other ventures include her fashion line SHE by Sherée, which failed to take off while she was on the show. In 2018, she debuted her Spring/Summer Athleisure Fashion Line.</p><p>Tyrone Gilliams’ absence from a meeting in Philadelphia during this season of The Real Housewives of Atlanta dashed Sheree Whitfield’s hopes for a happily ever after following their split.

The reality stars have reportedly been dating for more than two months. She met Holt through a mutual friend, and she has since introduced him to several of her friends and family members. The couple was seen taking selfies at the beach a few days ago.</p><p>On July 17, 2022, during Sheree’s appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, he asked the Atlanta Housewife about her love life. Sheree then <a href=# rel=noopener>revealed</a> that she had met someone new and that she is really enjoying getting to know someone in particular, before confirming to <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> that his name does not begin with a T and thus is not<strong> Tyrone.</strong></p><p>Her new boyfriend, Martell has been on Love & Marriage: Huntsville since its first season in 2018.

Sheree Whitfield, a former reality star&nbsp;was reunited with her boyfriend, Tyrone Gilliams, who was released from prison early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gilliams was sentenced to ten years in prison for wire fraud in 2013. He and Whitfield had dated prior to his arrest.</p><p>Whitfield visited him in a Kentucky prison on a regular basis after the couple reconnected in 2016. Moreover, she claimed the two communicated via love letters. Sheree spoke more about her ex on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, saying she hasn’t heard from him since the episode where he didn’t show up in Philadelphia in an earlier season of RHOA.</p><p>In 2013, Sheere’s ex-boyfriend, Gilliams, was sentenced to ten years in prison for wire fraud. Whitfield visited him in a Kentucky prison on a regular basis after the couple reconnected in 2016. He and his attorney were convicted of stealing more than <strong>$5 million</strong> from their investors. He had previously presented himself as a commodities trader, hip-hop promoter, and aspiring philanthropist. He attempted to improve his image by organizing a large charity event that featured several celebrities.</p><p>According to federal prosecutors, Gilliams and <strong>Everette Scott</strong> used their investors’ money for personal gain, spending it on luxury cars, jewelry, and travel. Scott received a 30-month prison sentence for his role in the scheme. Gilliams arrived at his 2013 sentencing with more than two dozen supporters, including his father, a minister in Philadelphia.
