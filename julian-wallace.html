He has many tattoos all through his body and face, as previously stated. He is also an Australian native, hailing from Brisbane. He began his profession in 2010 and has since risen to the top of the MMA globe.</p><p>This 5’8′′ fighter, who contends in the Bantamweight Division, has largely fought for Nitro MMA and XFC. And in between them, he worked hard to maintain his reputation for six years. Wallace, on the other hand, has a long list of accolades.</p><p>Furthermore, when his <a href=#>battle</a> with American MMA fighter Ben Nguyen in 2014 resurfaced, it drew much attention.</p><p>Wallace tried to scare Nguyen away during the pre-fight by forcing his fist into Ben’s chin, but he finally lost the contest. In addition, Julian was knocked out in the first round of his fight against Ben Nguyen after only 25 seconds. The fight video has now received over 67 million views on YouTube.</p><p>Still, every phase has its own time; Julian’s job could not last for long because his relationship with his betrothed was in shambles. Moreover, he became furious with her as a result of that. Unfortunately, he was instantly barred from competing in MMA in his late twenties.</p><p>As a result of the unanticipated media attention, ‘Julz the Jackal’ Julian Wallace’s career came to an end in this manner.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=julian-wallace-accused-of-domestic-violence>Julian Wallace Accused of Domestic Violence</h3><p>Jessica-Rose Clark claimed to be a victim of Julian Rabaud’s domestic violence on April 28. The story was also reported by The Daily Telegraph on Sunday.</p><p>On that day, Jessica, commonly known as Jessy, reported being 15 minutes late from work to home. Jess had to make a pit stop to get Wallace some noodles. When she arrived home, though, the MMA fighter assaulted her for delivering the incorrect food.</p><p>“He started attacking me. It went on for around 20 minutes, and he kicked me in the head with Timberland boots on,” Jess recalls the traumatic events. “Julian put me in a Thai headlock in the cuisine and was elbowing me in the face,” she said, “with one hand holding my head and the other striking me.”</p><p>Wallace also tried to rip off her engagement ring while threatening to break her fingers during that attempt. The scenario might have been far worse if Jess had not been an MMA fighter herself. On the other hand, the victim was left with bruises all over her neck and face.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=based-on-jessica-rose-clark-s-statements>Based on Jessica Rose Clark’s statements</h3><p>The assault on Jess lasted a long time. Moreover, Jessica says, “A muay Thai headlock struck me in the kitchen area, elbowing me in the face; I was also immediately hit with those fighter fists and booted on the head while he was wearing leather boots, forcing me to the ground and chocking me.”</p><p>She later noted that similar incidents had occurred previously but felt they had crossed the line. As a result, Jessy trusted her gut and summoned the confidence to address all of these issues publicly. In addition, Jess came out because she was horrified thinking about how similar things happened to other women, according to Clark.</p><p>Jessy believed they would never get out of such a terrible situation. On the other hand, Jess did everything she could to make their relationship work. She further claimed that she is an MMA pro and that the outcome was not as severe as it could have been.</p><p>“I remembered seeing begins and getting me placed onto the bed,” Jessy told Daily Mail Australia, “those days haunt me when I could feel myself losing consciousness slowly day by day.”</p><p>While interviewing the Daily Telegraph, she expressed her need to get free of her fiance’s enormous grasp. She also had the occasional idea that it might be the end of her life.</p><p>Similarly, there was a time when she blacked out completely and, in a desperate attempt to wake him up, continued tapping him on the arm.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=julian-wallace-s-assault-statements>Julian Wallace’s assault statements</h3><p>After all of Jessy Clark’s words were broadcast, the news was all over the television. This prominent tattooed MMA fighter involved in such an incident quickly became a big issue. Julian Wallace also admitted to the assault in a long message on his Facebook page, alleging their relationship strained.</p><p>Furthermore, the Australian fighter was forced to plead guilty to the accusations due to their current financial situation. He also made others and judges believe that he was frequently the victim as a cause for wanting Clark out of his life as quickly as possible.</p><p>Despite this, he stated that the partnership was having difficulties. Mr. Wallace did not contest his error in public posts on Facebook or in public statements to the media. He also liked to live alone and peacefully, pleading with others to leave him alone. In addition, after being assaulted on domestic violence, Julian Wallance posted on Facebook.</p><p>“There will be no penitentiary term for Julian Wallace,” the judge of Newtown Local Court added.

Moreover, he also didn’t want to spare any time, even though those in training are usually eager to put off what they have learned.</p><p>Furthermore, Julian used to dump a full bottle of water on his head instead of training.
