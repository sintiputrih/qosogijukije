They love you.”</span></p><p><span>Earlier on Sunday, the “What Do You Mean” singer had </span><a href=#>captioned a black-and-white shot </a><span>of himself with his new love, who has joined him on his tour in Japan, with the words: “I’m gonna make my Instagram private if you guys don’t stop the hate this is getting out of hand, if you guys are really fans you wouldn’t be so mean to people that I like.”</span></p><p><span>His fans instantly took offense to Bieber’s harsh reprimand, dismissing the singer for his threat.</span></p><p>“You don’t act like you love them,” one commenter wrote. “Respect them!

(He previously unfollowed her on the social media site in November 2014 after the pair split.)</span></p><p>"Justin Bieber recently followed Selena on Instagram," one Jelena believer tweeted after that took place.
