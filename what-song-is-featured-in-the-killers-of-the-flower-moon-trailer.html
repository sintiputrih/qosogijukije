Clocking in at just over two minutes, the trailer revealed the dark and somber setting of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Scorsese</a></strong>‘s masterful adaptation. Featuring all the serious faces, lurking threats, and a glimpse into the harrowing narrative, the trailer’s impact is further heightened by a blend of ancient and modern First Nation music in the background.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=484 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>Stretching to a three-hour runtime, the crime drama film is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">based on the nonfiction book</a> Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">written by author David Grann</a>. The novel looks into the murders of the Osage nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight when they discovered oil on their lands. They were granted the right to profit from the oil, but that didn’t stop white colonizers from trying to take this away from them.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The trailer sets a lot of this up</a> — there can’t really be spoilers when it is based on a book, but instead of focusing on the detective sent to try and “solve the mystery” of murders, it focuses on the corruption and evil of the men who use every means necessary to get their hands on the Osage Nation’s wealth.</p><h2 id=h-killers-of-the-flower-moon-trailer-soundtrack data-injectable=false>Killers of the Flower Moon trailer soundtrack</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>The trailer doesn’t hold back from the film’s brutality and is all set against the pounding soundtrack of “Stadium Pow Wow.” It is performed by the Canadian electronic music group Halluci Nation, blending various musical genres with First Nation music, focusing on vocals and drumming. All the members are First Nation and have performed around North America and Europe. Their style is described as Powwow-step, a combination of Indigenous and dubstep-influenced music for the club scene.</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>The use of “Stadium Pow Wow” makes for a rather fantastic sound backdrop for the trailer, staying true to the Indigenous story being told while adding an element of something dark bubbling away until it breaks out into violence. The thrilling soundtrack is emphasized by the gunshots, punches, and explosions featured in the footage. Halluci Nation’s other music can be found on their official band <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>The trailer brilliantly conveys the film’s unflinching realism, serving as a stark reminder of how brutal history has undoubtedly been. Catch <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Killers of the Flower Moon in theaters</a> this fall season on Oct. 20, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn5qsXai8r7OMoqpmnpWWwba%2BxJ1koqZdqbWmecqio6Wdoqh6sLKMrZ%2BeZZahvLix0WakqKeeYsGzrcilnKtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erin-foster-dating-history.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Erin Foster's Dating History?</span></a>
