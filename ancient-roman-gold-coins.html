Bonisoli explained that it’s unusual to find ancient coins from this era in a jar like the ones recently discovered.</p><p>Another unknown is how much the coins might be worth, although Italian media have reported that they very may well be <a href=# rel=noopener>worth millions of euros</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-188501 alt="Roman Coin Closeup" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/roman-coin-closeup.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-188501 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>MiBAC/Facebook</span></p><p>The historic 18th-century&nbsp;Cressoni Theater was first built in&nbsp;opened in 1870 before it turned into a cinema, which ultimately shut its doors in 1997.</p><p>The building was scheduled to be demolished in order to make way for a new apartment complex, but construction has been temporarily suspended following this latest discovery in order to give archeologists time to conduct more excavations at the site.</p><p>Indeed, researchers are anxious to see what else they can uncover.&nbsp;According to <a href=# rel=noopener>local archeology superintendent Luca Rinaldi</a>, “this finding demonstrates the effectiveness of the protection, knowledge and enhancement action carried out by the Ministry through the Superintendencies and encourages an even more concrete commitment to extending the practice of preventive archeology even in the context of private initiative.”</p><p>Rinaldi also added that this discovery is “practically an entire collection, unlike anything else ever found in northern Italy.”</p><p>Next, take a look at these&nbsp;<a href=#>photos of Pompeii’s victims</a>&nbsp;frozen in time.
