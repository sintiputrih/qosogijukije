Because a&nbsp;quick boredom-bred Google search of “<strong>Kristen Bell</strong> singing” led me&nbsp;down a rabbit hole of other celebrities I&nbsp;never knew had&nbsp;incredible voices.<strong> Jeremy Renner</strong>? What!<strong> Kate Winslet</strong> released a (very good) single? Who knew?! <strong>Leighton Meester</strong> sings better than anyone ever gave&nbsp;her credit for? It’s true! <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_kate-hudson data-tag=kate-hudson>Kate Hudson</a></strong> can&nbsp;bust out a Prince classic at a charity event&nbsp;and have it documented on Instagram? Cool!</p><p>Here, I’ve compiled a list of&nbsp;&nbsp;31 celebrity non-singers who have shockingly good singing voices. Check out all the videos below, then let me&nbsp;know which ones are your favorites—I really want to know!</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/howtoloseaguy_bestromcom.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/applying-mascara-adobe-2.png><h2>Kate Hudson</h2><p>As far as vocal chops&nbsp;go,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Hudson’s were&nbsp;meh&nbsp;in 2009’s “Nine,”</a>&nbsp;so I’d kind of written her off as an actress who’s also a wannabe singer. Then I watched her Instagram post over the weekend that showed her rendition of <a href=#>Prince’s</a> “Nothing Compares 2 U”—made famous by <strong>Sinead O’Conner</strong>—and silently apologized for that time I called her a wannabe. It’s real, real good.</p><h2>Jennifer Lawrence</h2><p><br>Because she’s the queen of self-deprecation, Jennifer Lawrence publicly claimed she hates singing in front of people, but was convinced to record a song for her “Hunger Games” sequel&nbsp;Mockingjay. And yet, the&nbsp;track—“The Hanging Tree”—debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 2014.&nbsp;The Lumineers’ <strong>Jeremiah Fraites</strong> and <strong>Wesley Schultz</strong> wrote the dramatic tune&nbsp;based on the lyrics from the book’s&nbsp;author <strong>Suzanne Collins</strong>.</p><h2><strong>Kristen Bell</strong></h2><p><br>She sang in Frozen, but Bell has some serious Broadway-caliber&nbsp;singing chops that I wouldn’t mind hearing more of soon.</p><h2><strong>Jeremy Renner</strong></h2><p><br>Guys, Renner’s voice is kind of bananas. Here he is singing “New York State of Mind.” <a href=# rel=nofollow>He also sings it here</a>, for <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong>, and it’s even better.</p><h2><strong>Zachary Levi</strong></h2><p><br>Holy Sinatra! Levi gives classic crooners a serious run for their money with his smooth&nbsp;singing voice.</p><h2><strong>Robert Downey Jr.</strong></h2><p><br>Is that <strong>Jakob Dylan</strong> or <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong>? Nope, it’s Downey! This will blow you away.</p><h2><strong>Kate Winslet</strong></h2><p><br>This one really shocked me: In 2001, Winslet released a single called “What If,” which was part of the animated film Christmas Carol: The Movie.</p><h2><strong>Emily Blunt</strong></h2><p><br>People had their doubts when they heard Blunt had been cast in&nbsp;a major role in the big-screen adaptation of Into the Woods, but this performance proves she always had pipes.</p><h2><strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span><br>You might not know&nbsp;that ScarJo has a singing voice that’s just as sultry as her looks. She even released an album of <strong>Tom Waits</strong> covers in 2007.</p><p><br>In this interview with <strong>Jordin Sparks</strong>, Washington plays down her singing talent, but when Sparks forces her to duet, you hear she’s really, really good.</p><h2><strong>Anna Kendrick</strong></h2><p><br>It wasn’t until Pitch Perfect that anyone knew this actress could sing, but here she is without any accompaniment, and she sounds fantastic.</p><h2><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span><br>Sure, she sang in the movie Country Strong, but Gwynnie also has some excellent pop chops, as evidenced by her cover of <strong>Pharrell</strong>‘s “Happy” on Glee.</p><h2><strong>Zooey Deschanel</strong></h2><p><br>I&nbsp;knew she had a band called She & Him, but thought most of her music involved twee vocals and ukuleles. Here, however, she belts out the moody&nbsp;classic “I Put a Spell on You,” and it’s excellent.</p><h2><strong>Seth MacFarlane</strong></h2><p><br>He might have created Family Guy, but Seth also is a talented&nbsp;musician and singer, having trained with the vocal coaches of <strong>Barbra Streisand</strong> and Frank Sinatra. He’s particularly adept at jazzy standards from the Great American Songbook.</p><h2><strong>Toni Colette</strong></h2><p><br>Whoa! Did you know this actress&nbsp;also fronts a band called&nbsp;Toni Collette & the Finish? And she’s really, really good.</p><h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2><p><br>Another reason why Colbert is downright awesome: The political satirist and TV host happens to be a huge <strong>Steven Sondheim</strong> fan and was cast&nbsp;as Harry in the 2011 New York Philharmonic production of Sondheim’s classic musical Company alongside <strong>Neil Patrick Harris</strong> and <strong>Patti LuPone</strong>.</p><h2><strong>Katey Sagal</strong></h2><p><br>The Sons of Anarchy actress—also known to some as Peg Bundy from Married with Children—got her start in the ’70s singing backup vocals for the likes of Bob Dylan, Bette Midler, and Tanya Tucker and has released two of her own albums.</p><h2><strong>Evan Rachel Wood</strong></h2><p><br>Whoa! Wood sounds killer during a performance of the 4 Non Blondes’ ’90s hit “What’s Up” at the Ides of March afterparty.</p><h2><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span><br>Before she was Carrie Bradshaw, SJP was Annie on Broadway.</p><h2><strong>Jennifer Love Hewitt</strong></h2><p><br>After becoming a teen sensation in the ’90s, Hewitt dabbled in singing and songwriting. While her original music&nbsp;never caught on, there’s no denying she can sing well.</p><h2><strong>Joseph Gordon Levitt</strong></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span><br>This indie actor has teamed up with Zooey Deschanel on a few cute songs, but this duet with <strong>Lady Gaga</strong> shows he’s got some range.</p><h2><strong>Amanda Seyfried</strong></h2><p><br>The&nbsp;soprano voice she used while playing&nbsp;Cosette in Les Miserables didn’t get amazing reviews—the part is really suited to a trained&nbsp;opera singer—but her cover of Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs’ moody 1966 hit “Li’l Red Riding Hood” is quiet perfection.</p><h2><strong>Leighton Meester</strong></h2><p><br>The Gossip Girl alum has a gorgeous <strong>Jewel</strong>-esque voice, but you’d never know it from her cheesy appearance on Cobra Starship’s 2009 song “Good Girls Go Bad.” In&nbsp;2012, she embarked on a mini tour with folk band Check in the Dark, with whom she had been working with since 2010. Listen to her amazing performances&nbsp;of “Heart Strings” and “Entitled” above.</p><h2><strong>Chris Pine</strong></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span><br>Pine slayed in the&nbsp;movie version of Into the Woods for a reason: He has a surprisingly good voice.</p><h2><strong>Taye Diggs</strong></h2><p><br>Did you know Diggs started out on Broadway? Yup, he played Benny in the hit musical Rent and reprised his role in the 2005 movie.</p><h2><strong>Milla Jovovich</strong></h2><p><br>Who knew this&nbsp;model and actress is also an accomplished singer?</p><h2><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></h2><p><br>There’s no denying Hudson is a better dancer than she is singer, but she certainly&nbsp;held her own alongside <strong>Lea Michele</strong> during her Glee stint.</p><h2><strong>Emmy Rossum</strong></h2><p><br>The Shameless starlet is a classically trained opera singer and starred in the big-screen version of Phantom of the Opera as Christine. Here, she sings&nbsp;an aria for&nbsp;<strong>Conan O’Brien,</strong> and it’s amazing.</p><h2><strong>Jada Pinkett Smith</strong></h2><p><br>This actress also has a band called Wicked Wisdom. Here she is belting out a rock song—she’s a remarkably good singer.</p><h2><strong>Taylor Momsen</strong></h2><p><br>The former Gossip Girl star has a band called the Pretty Reckless, but it never got a lot of credit, thanks to Taylor’s heavy-makeup-and-ripped-clothes schtick. However, when that’s taken away, there’s no denying she’s got a really solid rock voice.</p><h2><strong>Michael Cera</strong></h2><p><br>The quirky actor released a folksy solo album August 8, and it’s remarkably charming.</p><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2idnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pfHOAmHBrcGeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2LEqbuMoZivnV2otbCvyqKloKSpYrSwu8NmqqKml567qHnVqKCcnaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-surreal-life-season-8-cast-is-literally-surreal.html><span>←</span><span>'The Surreal Life' Season 8 Cast Is Literally Surreal</span></a>
