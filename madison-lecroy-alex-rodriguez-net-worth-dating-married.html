She had never physically seen him nor touched him.</span></p><p><span>In February, LeCroy said that Alex has never physically cheated on his fiancée with her after spreading the rumors. She doesn’t want anything bad for Alex or his family, and both of them were definitely innocent on that topic.</span></p><p><span>Due to the rumors that Alex Rodriguez was face timing, Madison LeCroy,&nbsp;Jennifer and Alex ended their 4 years relationship and two years engagement in march of 2021.

After the divorce, the couple was co-parenting their son together. Madison&nbsp;has kept her ex’s identity as private as possible since joining the Bravo show's cast in season 6 in 2019.</span></p><p><span>Although the couple had co-parented, being a single mom was so hard for her. As she said, Hudson was the reason for her enthusiasm to be successful. Josh also shared on Facebook that fatherhood had taught him about unconditional love, reinforced the importance of giving back, and taught him how to be a better person.</span></p><p><span>Madison was romantically involved with a cast member of Southern Charm, Austen Kroll,&nbsp;while she was debuting in season 6 of the series Southern Charm.&nbsp;Austen’s behavior, like heavy drinking, sleeping until noon, and then playing video games during the Covid-19 pandemic, turned her off. The&nbsp;couple split in December 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As reported by <a href=# rel=noopener>Hollywood Life</a>, After the breakup, Austen told that;</span></p><p><span><strong>"Madison and I have certainly tried to go our own ways, and we just find ourselves back with each other. I go to other people and I’m like. She’s just my person. And I’m telling myself to quit fighting it. And it’s just not cut-and-dried sometimes. I mean, I think that you love someone like this maybe only once in your life. So, it would be silly to walk away from it. Until all options are exhausted, Madison will be my person."</strong></span></p><p><span>Madison started dating Jay Cutler in 2021.&nbsp;At the time, Jay was recently divorced from his ex-wife Kristin Cavallari.

Kristen captioned:&nbsp;</span><strong>'The world is full of users. 10 years. Can’t break that.'</strong></p><p><span>As reported by <a href=# rel=noopener>The Sun</a>, Jay told Madison that he really doesn't appreciate that his name was between Madison and Kristin. And Madison replied that;</span></p><p><span><strong>"Jay I've done nothing but respect you and your privacy.
