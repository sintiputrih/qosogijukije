Singer, <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong> had a plan all mapped out at twenty-two years old. The Blank Space singer had plans for herself in the near future that did not always include being in the spotlight. Currently, Swift is on her way to fulfilling one of her goals, and in order to protect her personal life, <a href=#>she had been careful not to let publicity ruin her relationship with Joe Alwyn.</a></p><p>Let's take a look into the plans Taylor made in her twenties and see if she is now thanking herself at thirty-two.</p><h2 id=what-was-taylor-swift-39-s-first-breakthrough>What Was Taylor Swift's First Breakthrough?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift, whose full name is Taylor Alison Swift was born December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania. She is an American pop and country music singer-songwriter whose tales of young heartache achieved widespread success in the early 21st century.</p><p>Swift showed an interest in music at an early age, and she progressed quickly from roles in children’s theater to her first appearance before a crowd of thousands. She was age 11 when she sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” before a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game, and the following year she picked up the guitar and began to write songs.</p><p>Taking her inspiration from country music artists such as Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks, Swift crafted original material that reflected her experiences of tween alienation. When she was 13, Swift’s parents sold their farm in Pennsylvania to move to Hendersonville, Tennessee, so that she could devote more of her time to courting country labels in nearby Nashville.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# style=display:inline!important><strong>Reese Witherspoon Is A Swiftie?

According to Pop Culture, the "Shake It Off" songstress wanted to write and direct a feature film soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview at the Beacon Theater in New York City for the screening of her short film at this year's <a href=#>Tribeca Film Festival</a>, Swift said she was always "very curious" and always wanted to learn something. In the early years of her career in the music industry, the singer said she started going into the editing of her music videos and made changes. "It started with meddling, and it went from meddling with the edit to then writing the treatments for the music videos. That was almost ten years ago," she added.</p><p>The singer proved her creativity as she came up with ideas for music videos and collaborated with seasoned filmmakers to direct them.</p><p>In 2019, Swift directed her own music video for the first time for the song "The Man," which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Dark Meanings Behind These Taylor Swift Songs Are More Revealing Than She Intended</a></span></p><h2 id=was-taylor-swifts-prediction-for-her-future-spot-on>Was Taylor Swifts Prediction For Her Future Spot On?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the tender age of twenty-two in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview featured on the ABC network</a>, Taylor shared some personal views on where she sees herself in the future. Many fans were astonished by what she wanted at the time. When asked, "where do you see yourself 10 years from now," Swift replied without hesitation.</p><p>"In 10 years, I will hopefully know, either have a family or know when I want to have one or something." She further added that "I really want to end up happy, that's the biggest thing for me."</p><p>Now, at exactly 10 years later with Swift now 32 years old, she seems to be doing exactly where she wanted to be. Currently, Taylor Swift and boyfriend Joe Alwyn have successfully kept their relationship out of the public eye, lying low whether they're at one of her many houses in the US or his home in London.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources say that they've actually been engaged for a few months but have only told their inner-inner circle—basically immediate family, and trusted, very old friends.
