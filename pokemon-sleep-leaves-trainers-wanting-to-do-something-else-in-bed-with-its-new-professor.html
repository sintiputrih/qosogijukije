In a game based on sleep, players have someone else in mind that they want on their beds.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>Just like every other Pokémon game, a new professor with a plant-based name will be introduced. Professor Neroli is a researcher of Pokémon, and is interested in learning their sleep habits. And just like most professors in the franchise, this one is a cute young man with a Snorlax eye mask wrapped around his neck. He kinda looks like Professor Birch in the Hoenn region if you think about it, but with some differences.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=de dir=ltr>Serebii Update: Professor Neroli is the researcher in Pokémon Sleep <a href=#>https://t.co/NWlAdn57aQ</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VuVXaIFgnE</a></p>— Serebii.net (@SerebiiNet) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=852 data-injectable=true>But if there is one thing we know about the Pokémon community, it’s that Rule 34 will take over their minds, even in an innocent PokéGame. And this mentality also applies to humans, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not just “humanoid-like” Pokémon</a> (looking at you <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Markiplier</a>). Since the professor’s reveal, many have fantasized about him, ahem, “in bed,” if you catch our drift. From innocent cuddling to something more explicit, The Pokémon Company should just change the game where every time the player wakes up, we see a professor with the Pokémon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>he's hot, thank god <a href=#>https://t.co/GFKRoAwmip</a></p>— Bert (@tsombert) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who built like this let me snuggle your belly <a href=#>https://t.co/DKH8ltKjs5</a></p>— 𝗥𝗮𝗹𝘀 🔞 (@BiggerRalsei) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>he is a dream daddy 😍 <a href=#>https://t.co/rM7gaVgowg</a></p>— Tate's Personal Hole (@tates_hole) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=pt dir=ltr>professor neroli 💦💦💦 <a href=#>#PokemonPresents</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dwBhqFPSlJ</a></p>— Giacomo "Serj" Favilla #Sunbreak ⚔️ (@ooserjoo) <a href=#>February 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Interestingly, there is some science behind why Neroli was the “chosen plant” for this Pokémon professor. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an article </a>published by Sleep Better Georgia, oils from the Neroli plant, when extracted and diffused, can help people sleep. But another study published in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">National Library of Medicine</a> showed that neroli can also increase sexual desire.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>It seems like The Pokémon Company did really diligent research on plants, knowing that there will be people thirsting for him.
