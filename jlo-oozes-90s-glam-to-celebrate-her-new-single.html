For this occasion, the songstress opted for a pair of large and in charge gold hoop earrings, a pair of dark tortoiseshell sunglasses, lots of chunky rings in gold and black, a warm brown manicure and her signature nude lip.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=erUZMvlzupI data-wc=77>Jen hosted her Sunday luncheon at the famed West Hollywood gay bar, The Abbey Weho, and enlisted her latest brand venture, Delola, to bring the party. Delola is Jen’s latest love child which specialises in pre-mixed world-class cocktails. Not afraid of a little hard work, Jen can be seen behind the bar serving up her favourite fruity delights to her guests, proving that she really can do it all and look chicer than ever whilst doing so.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=etMtkCLnup2 data-wc=81>Jen has always had a penchant for the iconic fashion of the 1990s, and her latest music video for the celebratory anthem is a testament to this enduring style. The video serves as a vibrant showcase of Jen's adoration for this era's fashion. Throughout the video, Jen dazzles in an array of eye-catching <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>white wedding dresses</a>. She is seen flaunting brightly colored collared shirts, which she pairs with statement-making chunky gold jewelry, embracing both elegance and boldness.&nbsp;</p><p id=evp6EIX65A- data-wc=50>A particular highlight is a chic puff skirt mini dress, which she stylishly complements with thigh-high stockings adorned with delicate lace trimmings. The look is completed with a striking red floral waist accent, adding a splash of color and flair that perfectly encapsulates the 90s vibe with a contemporary twist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue8WaqqGhn6N6tb7Ep5usZ2VmfnOBj2ihpaddpLy7sdJmcGmrXZy5ormMraZmm5WhsqO%2BwK2cZqCVp3qvsdZmqqKml6GycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyson-unkrich.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Alfonso Ribeiros Wife Angela Unkrich?
