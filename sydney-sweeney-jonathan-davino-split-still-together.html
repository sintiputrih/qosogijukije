They seemed to have gone private with their relationship and even refrained from talking about each other over interviews.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, what was going on? Are they still together? Or have they split already? Find answers as you scroll down.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Are Sydney Sweeney And Jonathan Davino Still Together? Have They Split?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to the Jan 2022 reports, Sydney Sweeney and Jonathan Davino were still together.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The couple first came to the spotlight back in October 2018 after sharing dinner at Spring Place for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>InStyle</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and Kate Spade. Since then, they were often spotted together on numerous occasions including Jonathan’s birthday in 2019 at TAO Chicago nightclub.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But it has been quite a while since we last saw them in July 2021 while on a beach vacation in Italy. The lovebirds were captured getting cozy on a boat, and bathing under the sun at the time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Naturally, fans would be curious if the two have split. Moreover, Sydney shared with </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>EliteDaily</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> that she was “with a friend” during her beachside vacation, and this raised a lot of questions.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But while a few may have trusted Sydney, many were quick to point out that they don’t kiss their friends like that. They believed that the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Euphoria</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> star was just trying to throw people off the scent.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And to talk about “throwing people off the scent”, Sydney’s a master at it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back when her first PDA pictures with Jonathan surfaced in 2020, a fan reacted with a tweet, “Sydney Sweeney has a man… thanksgiving canceled.” Surprisingly, she responded to the tweet sharing a photo of herself at prom with a girl, captioned, “baby girl go have a feast. your girl at prom ;).”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fans were in uproar then. “Sydney Sweeney likes girls too… I have to lay down for 85 hours just to process this um,” a user wrote.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, another tweeted, “I don’t think I realized Sydney Sweeney isn’t straight this is the best day of my life.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In the end, fans were arguing about whether she liked girls or not, instead of discussing her relationship with Jonathan. Well done, Sydney.</span></p><h3><strong>When Did Jonathan Davino And Sydney Sweeney Begin Dating?</strong></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>As mentioned before, it was October 2018 when Jonathan Davino and Sydney Sweeney first came to the limelight after sharing dinner at Spring Place for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>InStyle</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and Kate Spade. So, it was probably sometime before that the two began dating.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, fans only became sure of their relationship in November 2020. It was after her PDA on the beach and her IG posts with her dog Tink. Yes, don’t be surprised. It wasn’t her pics with the dog, rather fans were intrigued about the person who took these photos.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But as to the date of writing this article, neither of the lovebirds had revealed how or when they first met.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>What’s more, Jonathan had yet to make his appearance on Sydney’s IG @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>sydney_sweeney</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> then.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Jonathan Davino, Sydney Sweeney Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jonathan Davino was born in 1983, making him 14 years younger than Sydney. This Italian man co-owned the restaurant called </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Pompeii Xpress</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> at 2931 N. Broadway Ave in Lakeview along with his father Roger.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, the pizza company “Pompei” was founded by Luigi Davino in 1909. Over time, the family business from just a small bakery specializing in bread and limited pans of pizza turned to the quick service Italian Restaurant it is today.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But the franchise was owned by his uncle, Ralph Davino, and Jonathan had opened a branch without his permission. Thus, sued by his uncle later Jonathan was forced to change the restaurant’s name to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Davino’s Xpress</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking about his family, Jonathan is the son of Roger and Velda Davino. Some of his siblings and cousins’ names included Kimi, Tommy, Mark, Carissa, Robert, Jimmy, and Anthony.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jonathan is a hard man to find. Unlike his girlfriend who flaunted a massive fan following, he had no social media presence.</span></p><h3><b>Sydney Sweeney Dating History</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sydney Sweeney is hesitant about sharing her current dating life, let alone her past.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This American actress was born on September 12, 1997, in Spokane, Washington, USA, and made her debut in the movie </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> as “Lisa” at the age of 12.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since then, Sydney has appeared in over 40 movies and TV series including the popular </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Grey’s Anatomy</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2005), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>90210</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (208), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Pretty Little Liars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2017), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>In the Vault </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>(2017), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Everything Sucks! </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>(2018), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Handmaid’s Tale</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2018), and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The White Lotus </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>(2021).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Recalling her journey, Sydney shared, “I grew up in a family that when we moved to Los Angeles, the prices were so different from where I grew up in Spokane, Washington.” It seems that her parents struggled financially and even had to file for bankruptcy when she was a teenager.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But things are different now. Sydney flaunts a net worth of $ million as of 2022, and her parents are living the dream. Moreover, Sydney’s brother Trent Sweeney is also an actor/assistant director, making his parents the proudest.</span></p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmrLGUo7K6edKwnJ6mla56q7vNmquhmZ5isaLCyKemZqugoba1edKtoKWkXam8qLHToZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-perrys-nightmare-to-work-with-co-star-elizabeth-hurley.html><span>←</span><span>One Of Matthew Perry's Famous Co-Stars Labeled Him A &amp;quot;Nightmare&amp;quot; To Work With</span></a>
