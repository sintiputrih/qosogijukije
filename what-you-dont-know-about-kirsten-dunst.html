However, according to director Peyton Reed, Dunst actually passed on the role of Torrance Shipman in the 2000 film about a rah-rah rivalry. "She wasn't interested. She was booked for another movie," Reed recalled to <a href=#>Insider</a>. The director's second choice was Marley Shelton — who turned the role down to play a cheerleader in a different movie, "Sugar & Spice."</p><p>Reed reached out to Dunst again, and after a discussion about alterations to the script, the actor agreed to play Torrance. Interestingly, her future "Spider-Man" co-star James Franco wanted to be the one brushing teeth beside her in the movie, but he lost the role of her love interest to Jesse Bradford.</p><p>Even though she was hesitant about the film at first, Dunst became one of its biggest cheerleaders. "You know what I like about this movie? It doesn't show cheerleaders in a bad light. It shows how hard they work," she told <a href=#>Interview</a>. Still, she admitted that she was surprised by the movie's success when recounting an accurate prediction one of her family members made. "My brother was like, 'This is gonna be huge!'" she recalled on the "<a href=#>Awards Chatter</a>" podcast. "And I was like, 'Really, Christian?' He was like, 'Yes!'" In a 2019 appearance on "<a href=#>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>," Dunst said that she would totally bring it in a sequel, so our spirit fingers are crossed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmpmaoV2e9ahmK1lqaTCbrDOp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWbnr%2B0wMSnZJ2tnqjBcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-cris-collinsworth.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to Cris Collinsworth?
