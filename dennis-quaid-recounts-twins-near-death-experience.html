It's bigger than breast cancer. It's bigger than automobile accidents and yet, no one seems to really be aware of the problem."</p><p>His claim echoes the findings of a 1999 report by the US Institute of Medicine, which asserted that "good people are working in bad systems that need to be made safer."</p><p>In the Quaids' case, staff at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center near Beverly Hills gave their two-week-old twins, Thomas Boone and Zoe Grace, 1,000 times the recommended dose of the blood thinner heparin last November.</p><p>"It basically turned their blood to the consistency of water, where it had a complete inability to clot. They were basically bleeding out at that point," Quaid said.</p><p>Making matters worse, the hospital did not notify Quaid and his wife, Kimberly, that anything was wrong until the next day. Compounding the insult, the Quaids told the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> in January that they believed someone at the hospital leaked information about the error to the news media.</p><p>The twins, who were delivered by a surrogate, are now doing well, with no apparent ill effects.</p><p>Quaid and his wife Kimberley Buffington are suing the drug's manufacturer, Baxter International, which has said the product was safe but that the label was misread by a hospital staffer.</p><p>Quaid, star of such films as <i>The Parent Trap</i> and <i>The Rookie</i>, acknowledged as much during the <i>60 Minutes</i> interview, saying "the nurse didn't bother to look at the dosage on the bottle."</p><p>- REUTERS</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxprrNoqpmqaWWtqV50Z6aqK2eqcBuwNaipaxlnpqus3nDnpitoF2axbGx0aKcp5uVZJyamKmTkIaLeXeBlY2mfoyIb36EmnaTkodraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taraji-p-henson.html><span>←</span><span>Taraji P Henson Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
