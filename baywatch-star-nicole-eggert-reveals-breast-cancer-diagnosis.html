I immediately went to my general practitioner and she told me I had to immediately go get it looked at. But the problem was I just couldn’t get an appointment. Everything was booked. So I had to wait until the end of November to get it done. This journey’s been rough for me.

It’s there. It needs to be taken out. So it’s just a matter of do I have to do treatment before the surgery or can they perform the surgery and then I do the treatment after.“I have panics where I’m like, just get this out of me, You sit there and it’s in you and you’re like, every second that passes and it’s inside of me.
