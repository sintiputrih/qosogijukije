As a result, he was sidelined for 21 days.</p><p>After his hand injury, Lester was back working with assistant coach Cody Toppert on August 6, 2020.</p><p>Well, coach Cody was quite happy about seeing a hard-working player hopping back again in the game.</p><p><strong>Don’t forget to check out:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>&lt;&lt;Sam Mills Bio: Early Life, Professional Career, NFL & Cancer >></strong></a></p><h3>Under the limelight because of his short shorts</h3><p>Well, people who have seen him playing must have addressed his shorts, which are too short. Ever gave it a thought; why does this guard wear his shorts too short? Here’s the answer.</p><p>The Memphis Guard, Lester Quinones, has gathered much of the highlights because of his out-of-the-box sense of style.</p><p>Lester’s attire made a lot of buzz in the town as the topic expanded in the google trend. Even above the great players like Precious Achiuwa and James Wiseman.</p><p>Even his head coach at Memphis, Penny Hardaway, had to smile and save his team from negativity.</p><p>His thoughts on Lester’s shorts were clear. As per the head coach, love them or hate them; shorts are simple. He wants to define his era with the shorts he wears.</p><p>Lester wore those shorts since his IMG days. He used to roll the shorts and tuck them into his compression undershorts.</p><p>So the rolled part does not fall. It was his style. However, his teammates were still confused about his wardrobe choice.</p><p>Let’s hear what Lester feels about the shorts. During one of the interviews with Memphis Commercial Appeal, he mentioned it saying,</p><p>“It is just my kind of thing, and it is just me. It is different. We need some more shorts in basketball; it is a great quote that should not be changed.”</p><h2>Lester Quinones | Personal Life</h2><p>After his short shorts, the most apparel question that must have filled the google search feed is his relationship status.</p><p>He has become Memphis’s heartthrob but recently became a fan favorite.</p><p>Keeping all your curiosities in mind, we scanned over all the internet pages on his relationship status, but sadly, we cannot conclude.</p><p>And this probably indicates that Lester is single and must focus on his career for the time being.</p><p>And that’s okay; being serious and prudent towards your passion, future, and career is not wrong.</p><p>As mentioned above, he is designing his life the way he dreamed. Moreover, his versatility is his strong point.</p><p>He can do everything equally, shoot, pass, rebound, defend. But as of now, he wants to get better at handling traps and pressure off the ball screen.</p><p>Keeping the talk of his relationship status aside, Lester is more of a family guy. His parents mean a lot to him, and nothing is more important than his parents.</p><h2>Lester Quinones | Net Worth</h2><p>Lester is still running with his collegiate career, which directly indicates he has not joined anywhere professionally.</p><p>He is a promising player with some versatile capacity and explicit talent. He will surely make it to the NBA, and once he is there, he will be unstoppable.</p><p>And why not? Lester was busy improving his game and play style when everybody else was partying and chilling in Brentwood.</p><p>Not to mention, Lester also receives compensation after joining Memphis to cover his tuition fees and other expenses, including housing facilities.</p><p><strong>You can also read about yet another college basketball player:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>&lt;&lt;Jaden Springer Bio: Early Life, College, Girlfriend & Net Worth >></a></strong></p><h2>Social Media Presence:</h2><p>Moving on to his social media presence, Lester is available on Twitter and Instagram.
