In the aftermath, they discover they’re werewolves, and develop an intense bond together,” the synopsis reads. “The two team up, and encounter two other teenagers, the adoptive children of a park ranger, who went through a similar strange wildfire sixteen years ago.”</p><p>In July 2022, creator <strong>Jeff Davis</strong> opened up about getting to work with Gellar on the project.</p><p>“Everyone knows that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was a huge influence on Teen Wolf,” the writer said during a panel for Teen Wolf at San Diego Comic Con. “So I always thought it would be amazing if we could bring Sarah Michelle Gellar back to a horror show.”</p><p>The horror icon, who made a surprise appearance at the convention, added, “Everything these guys have been saying about family and the atmosphere of Jeff’s shows is really true.

According to Paramount+, the character is “a highly regarded expert in her field and no stranger to personal loss, brought in by authorities to catch the teenage arsonist who started a massive wildfire which may have also led to the reawakening of a supernatural predator terrorizing Los Angeles.”</p><p>Along with Wolf Pack, the streaming service <a href=#>is also set to release a Teen Wolf revival movie</a>.
