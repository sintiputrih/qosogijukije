He apologized publicly at the time.</p><p>Later that year, Josh’s name appeared in a data breach of the dating website Ashley Madison, which caters to users in relationships. In a statement at the time, the Arkansas native admitted to cheating on his wife and claimed that he had a “secret addiction” to “viewing pornography on the internet.” In August 2015, he checked into a six-month rehab program at a faith-based treatment facility.</p><p>The eldest Duggar made headlines again in April 2021 when he was arrested for receiving and possessing child pornography. After being taken into custody, he was released on bond and pleaded not guilty to all charges. Two months later, TLC announced the cancellation of 19 Kids and Counting spinoff Counting On, which had aired since 2015.</p><p>In August 2021, Josh’s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him, claiming that prosecutors failed to preserve evidence that could have proved his innocence.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnmqTAqXnDrp6gmaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./young-thug-lyrics-ysl-indictment-html.html><span>←</span><span>Here Are the Rap Lyrics Being Used in the YSL Trial</span></a>
