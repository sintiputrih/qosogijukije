Most dating shows take singles and place them all together in order to find a relationship, but not this time. No, this show takes a couple that is already in a relationship- one of them wants to get married, and the other doesn't and places them in a house with other couples in the same situation. According to the Netflix description, "an ultimatum is issued—and in just over eight weeks, they must commit to marriage, or move on. In the meantime, each will choose a new potential partner from one of the other couples, in a life-changing opportunity to get a glimpse of two different possible futures."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Netflix's Dating Around: Interesting Facts About Making The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-hosting-39-the-ultimatum-marry-or-move-on-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Who Is Hosting 'The Ultimatum: Marry Or Move On'?</span></h2><p>If you are a fan of dating shows, you might recognize these familiar faces.
