The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanderpump Rules</a> star went hard and took off his shirt during the Tom Sandoval & the Most Extras performance at The Canyon venue in Montclair, California. About 40 miles away at Hollywood’s Avalon, Ariana went harder with an epic ladies’ night alongside castmates <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Katie Maloney</strong></a>, where they reportedly took over the DJ booth to chant, “F*** Tom.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In a clip of Tom’s shirtless set posted to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram </a>(above), the singer put on his best Irish accent for his cover of The Pogues’ “I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)”. Another video (below) had him crooning the hit “Drive” by Incubus. He appeared focused on his dulcet tones instead of the fallout from his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>affair</a> with costar&nbsp;<b><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Raquel Leviss.</a></b></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The “Scandoval” was clearly on the minds of Ariana, Scheana and Katie, however, as they reportedly dragged Tom during their night out.
