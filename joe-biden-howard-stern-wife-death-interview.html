There's no doubt the pair have come a long way since <a href=#>Trump publicly praised Stern at his most iconic hotel</a>. But Stern and Trump's relationship soured over politics. And on April 2024, Stern seemed to continue to try and sway his voters away from voting for Trump by <strong>interviewing President Joe Biden</strong>.</p><p>While <a href=#>Howard Stern first became successful</a> by shocking his audience, he has evolved into a rather prolific and profound interviewer. So much so that a sitting <strong>President sat down with Stern in the studio.</strong> During Stern's April 26th, 2024 interview with the President, Biden revealed the emotional <strong>turmoil he faced when he tragically lost his first wife, daughter, and later his son, Beau</strong>. While Biden has been open about this before, he has really been as raw as he was with the self-proclaimed King Of All Media. This article will delve into what Biden said about the great losses in his life and then delve into <strong>how he met his first wife, Neilia</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=president-joe-biden-fought-tears-while-discussing-the-deaths-of-his-wife-and-kids-during-howard-stern-interview>President Joe Biden Fought Tears While Discussing The Deaths Of His Wife And Kids During Howard Stern Interview</h2><p>The biggest news from <strong>President Joe Biden's April 26th, 2024 interview with Howard Stern</strong> is that he revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's planning on debating former President Donald Trump</a>. But this was really just a throw-away line in the lengthy interview. While Stern certainly set Biden up for a load of soft-ball questions, something that numerous critics have accused multiple interviewers of doing with him lately, the radio legend actually spent the most time on personal matters. Specifically, <strong>Stern inquired about the deaths that have sounded Joe Biden throughout his life</strong>.</p><p>Without question, Howard Stern skillfully and thoughtfully opened the current President up that few have before. Numerous times during the interview, <strong>Biden could be heard choking up and fighting back tears</strong>. When things got too personal and painful, he'd simply say, "Anyway".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the most painful moments in Biden's life were discussed.

He claimed that this was a fleeting thought in a great moment of pain. Not because he was overwhelmed with grief but because he felt he could never reach the height of happiness he once felt again. What stopped him from jumping off a bridge was his duty to his sons, who were recovering from the car accident in hospital.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“You don’t have to be crazy to commit suicide.

During his interview with Stern, President Biden recalled how his mother and his brothers and sisters moved in with him and helped him put the pieces back together. While describing this, Biden was clearly very moved. On top of this, he seemed exceedingly comfortable with Howard Stern and the sensitivity he had while asking his questions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/donald-and-ivanka-trump-didn-t-hesitate-to-answer-after-howard-stern-asked-them-if-they-ever-had-_the-talk_-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg><p>President Joe Biden also held back tears while describing <strong>the death of his Joseph Robinette "Beau" Biden III. </strong>While Stern didn't press too much on this sensitive topic, Biden did describe how difficult his son's untimely passing was.</p><ul><li>Beau Biden died on May 30th, 2015</li><li>Beau Biden had an aggressive brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-joe-biden-met-his-first-wife-neilia>How Joe Biden Met His First Wife Neilia</h2><p>While discussing the "horrible point" in President Joe Biden's life surrounding the death of his first wife, Neilia Hunter, <strong>Howard Stern inquired about how they first met</strong>. Biden <strong>met his "Homecoming Queen" first wife in Nassau, Bahamas</strong> on Spring Break. He was in law school at the time and he saw this "particularly attractive" woman at a hotel pool that they crashed. Biden decided to talk to her.</p><p>"I said, 'Hi my name is Joe Biden, I'm from Delaware'," President Biden recalled during his interview with Howard Stern.

And I said, 'Why don't we go to dinner?'"</p><p><strong>Neilia agreed and went for hamburgers with Biden</strong>. But, at the time, Biden was skint poor. Neilia came from a wealthy family and could see Biden was struggling with the bill. So, she slapped some money on Biden's knee from under the table. While Biden was embarrassed, she brushed it off. And it was at that moment the two fell for each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[That night] I never kissed her.
