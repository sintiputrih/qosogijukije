With black string straps and string tied at the waist, the little two-piece looked drop dead stunning on the 23-year-old. She wasn’t the only one dazzling in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">chic swimwear</a>, though.</p><p>Hadid also was seen in an itty-bitty low-rise swimsuit that showed off her incredibly toned tummy. Hers was a more colorful <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tie-dye </a>style, but it was definitely just as scant.</p><p>Along with the on-point bikinis, the models’ off-duty traveling looks were just as enviable. While Hadid opted for a cropped cream cardigan from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Musier</a>, red shorts, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dad sneakers</a> and ankle socks, Baldwin was truly too cool for school in an all-black ensemble. She paired dark biker shorts with an oversize WB crewneck sweatshirt, topping off the look with a messy top-knot and white kicks.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>We only wish we looked this good when we flew!

The pair is there to work on a campaign shoot together.</p><p>There were then, of course, a few safety precautions that the duo took since they’re traveling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">amid the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. While both wore <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">protective face masks</a>, Baldwin took it a step further and kept on black leather gloves.</p><p>From fashionable travel gear to barely there bikinis, keep scrolling to see Hadid and Baldwin slay from all angles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvHmqClnalir6K4w7Cgp2WRo7FursSlo5plmJaxqrCMoqVmmpmgtq%2B10mamp2WRYsair8etZKKmXZ7BorjYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doug-pederson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-218819-html.html><span>←</span><span>Doug Pederson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
