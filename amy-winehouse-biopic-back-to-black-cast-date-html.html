The upcoming Amy Winehouse biopic will star Industry breakout Marisa Abela, <a href=#>Deadline</a> reported on January 12, 2023. Focus Features and Monumental Pictures are partnering with Studiocanal on the movie, with filming set to begin that month in London. Several Winehouse biopics have been developed since her death, but none have come to fruition. Winehouse’s family agreed to <a href=#>a biopic deal</a> with <a href=#>Monumental Pictures in 2018</a> to have her life story adapted by Kinky Boots writer Geoff Deane. Lotus Entertainment cast <a href=#>Noomi Rapace</a> as Winehouse in 2015, with Kirsten Sheridan directing, but that project ultimately did not get made. In late 2021, another biopic, <a href=#>Saving Amy</a>, was reportedly in the works from Halcyon Studios, despite Winehouse’s father’s <a href=#>objections</a>. While the <a href=#>Winehouse hologram</a> waits in the wings for her big break, here’s all the cast, plot, and release-date details for Back to Black.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clr9dwp1r000c3b7yhey9cihu@published>Is there a trailer?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clr9e02tm000q3b7ysc6mkz8f@published data-word-count=102>A teaser for Back to Black gives an early look at Marisa Abela’s turn as Winehouse, big hair and all. The clip hits the usual music-biopic beats: establishing that Winehouse just wants to be an artist, setting up her rise from small rooms to ravenous crowds, showing her struggles with fame via her being chased by paparazzi. “You gotta remember, I ain’t no Spice Girl,” Abela says, in her best London accent. We also see a lot of Jack O’Connell as Blake Fielder-Civil, Winehouse’s onetime husband. It’s all set, of course, to “Back to Black” — a new version sung by Abela.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clcuy81pc000i3b6v6lplrn51@published>Who’s in the cast?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcuy8b7k000m3b6vtq74qbe3@published data-word-count=179><a href=#>Variety reported</a> in July 2022 that the upcoming Amy Winehouse biopic was in talks with Marisa Abela, who currently plays hyperqualified Yasmin on <a href=#>Industry</a>, to portray the late singer, adding that Abela “is a frontrunner” and there were “a small group of other actors” still vying for the role. <a href=#>Deadline</a> confirmed the news on January 13, three days before filming. Abela fits a lot of what the team — including director Sam Taylor-Johnson, a friend of Winehouse’s, and Mitch Winehouse, Amy’s father — is allegedly looking for. Per Variety, Abela’s Jewish background is important, as is the 25-year-old’s just-burgeoning fame. Mitch told the Sun in 2018 that he wanted “an unknown, young, English — London, Cockney — actress who looks a bit like Amy” to play his daughter as opposed to a massive star like Lady Gaga. As for matching Winehouse’s legendary vocals, Abela has never sung onscreen, although her profile on the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art lists singing as a skill. Surely, the team would’ve <a href=#>said no, no, no</a> to someone without the vocal chops, right? Wrong!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cld3rud8t000j3b6vyaaoc1fr@published data-word-count=53><a href=#>Per Deadline</a>, Unbroken star Jack O’Connell will star as Blake Fielder-Civil, whom Winehouse divorced in 2009 after a famously rocky marriage. Eddie Marsan (The World’s End) will play Winehouse’s father, while The Crown’s <a href=#>Lesley Manville</a> will fill the family tree out as Winehouse’s maternal grandmother. Additional cast members have yet to be announced.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>First look at Marisa Abela as Amy Winehouse in Sam Taylor-Johnson’s BACK TO BLACK <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OFRyVkXO4z</a></p>— Film Updates (@FilmUpdates) <a href=#>January 13, 2023</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clcuya9bv000q3b6v8kc7ss32@published>What’s the plot?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl658n4fg000n3h6hik0nejdp@published data-word-count=136>There has been plenty of talk of a biopic since Amy Winehouse’s death; studios left and right are trying to make a film about the late singer’s life, especially after the <a href=#>Amy documentary</a> won the Oscar in <a href=#>2015</a>. While many have not made it past development, there is a new candidate that might make it into theaters. With Sam Taylor-Johnson (Fifty Shades of Grey) directing a script written by Matt Greenhalgh, the film will look at the London singer’s life up until her death in 2011. In <a href=#>a recent press release</a>, the film was described as “a journey that took her from the craziness and color of 90’s Camden High Street to global adoration — and back again.” The Amy Winehouse estate is reportedly <a href=#>supporting the film</a>, despite recent objections to other adaptations of Winehouse’s life.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clcuyixkl000v3b6vb2hwk3hc@published>When will Back to Black be released?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcuyjah100103b6v7fi4a4fx@published data-word-count=14>The film is comin’ on over to the United States on May 10, 2024.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl65ab7ma000y3e6op03g9qhq@published data-word-count=5>This post has been updated.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Deadline</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Deadline</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>variety</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl5b2dq8s000021olsl0y56cj@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Myha’la Herrold Knows She’s Good</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl4y8y7bt00004hof1sjsvfdl@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>An Immaculate Collection of Details About Madonna’s Self-Written Biopic</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl5v8ec730012vsoo7g1x179i@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Morally Bankrupt Finance Grads Are Back in the Industry Season-Two Trailer</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Marisa Abela’s Day (to Play Amy Winehouse) Has Come</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgZnyiudhmrqKmlZ28tr%2FEZpmip6CesG6uwJyiZqyfYq%2BtrcKkZJyZo6l6pa3TnmWhrJ2h</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lauren-london-net-worth-details-about-movie-income-age-home-career.html><span>←</span><span>Lauren London Net Worth: Details About Movie, Income, Age, Home, Career - SarkariResult</span></a>
