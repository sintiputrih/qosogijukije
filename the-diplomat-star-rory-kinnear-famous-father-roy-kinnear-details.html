Despite being an inexperienced rider, Roy had not been offered a stunt double on the film and when his horse unexpectedly slipped, he was left with a fractured pelvis. The next day, it was announced that Roy had tragically died in hospital from a heart attack. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/611f9f842035-roy-kinnear-willy-wonka-movie-gene-wilder.jpg><p id=eT7ARlhByom data-wc=48>Rory was just 10 years old when his father died, and has spoken about the lack of health and safety measures on film sets. Last year, he told the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Observer</a>: "No one has ever seen a shot and thought, 'That is worth the death of whoever made it'."</p><p id=e5W6l0-0-o7 data-wc=46>The actor recalled: "He wrote a letter to my mum just before he set off, saying, 'Just about to do a stunt that even the stuntmen have said is too dangerous'. They all knew, and yet the shot was still prioritised over the safety of actors."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/7cc384bdf1a7-rory-kinnear-film-premiere.jpg><p id=eiZmpz025c0 data-wc=83>Despite losing his father, however, Rory continues to feel close to him. "That's the other thing you learn in grief, and maybe this is why I'm not scared of it, is the relationship continues," he explained to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian</a>. "It grows and deepens in their absence. And if the relationship was a happy one, the umbrella of love and kindness carries on. And though you only had 10 years it was a period central to your existence. It is undeniable in your memory."&nbsp;</p><p id=ePe4sr_-2i data-wc=26><strong>Don't want to miss a story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
