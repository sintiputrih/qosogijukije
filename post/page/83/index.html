<a href=../../../tzedakah-in-the-jewish-tradition.html></a>
Tzedakah is loosely translated as “charity,” but that is a misrepresentation of the concept. The Hebrew has its root in another word, tzedek/justice. In the Torah we are strongly enjoined, “Tzedek, tsedek tirdof/Justice, justice thou shalt pursue.” Rabbinical commentators have said that the repetition of the word justice is designed to underline the importance of the command. Tzedakah is not charity given out of caritas, in the Christian understanding of those words; it is given as an act of redress, as part of the process of seeking a just world.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Was Christine Baumgartner Spending Just As Over The Top As Kevin Costner's Before Their Contentious</h2><time>May 29, 2024</time>

Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner’s divorce has been playing out in the tabloids for months, with recent reports suggesting a deadlock in child support negotiations. Baumgartner, who's been married to Costner for close to two decades, is reportedly demanding nearly $250,000 in child support, an amount that Costner believes is intended not for the children, but to support her extravagant lifestyle. Though a millionaire in her own right, Baumgartner’s $7 million net worth comes nowhere near Costner’s eye-watering $250 million, suggesting that quite a bit of the Yellowstone star's net worth went to maintaining his estranged wife’s lifestyle.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What is a wet tap in construction?</h2><time>May 29, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../what-is-a-wet-tap-in-construction-html.html></a>
Answer
What exactly is a Wet Tap? Wet tapping is a process that allows us to tap into existing pressurised pipes without interfering with the flow of the fluid. Most wet taps are performed on potable water, recycled water, and sewer lines; hence any delay in service may be annoying at best and even life threatening when done incorrectly.
In a similar vein, how does a wet tap function?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Zelda Tears of the Kingdom: How to Use Old Map</h2><time>May 29, 2024</time>
