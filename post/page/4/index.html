Ancient Hebrew civilizations also saw the mandrake as a potent and powerful plant and used it as a way to induce pregnancy in women. This belief stems from a reference to mandrakes in the Book of Genesis, which tells of how Rachel used mandrake berries to conceive a child, per Gardening Know How.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Nevershoutnever!

I'm in trouble I'm an addict
I'm addicted to this girl
She's got my heart tied in a knot
And my stomach in a whirl
But even worse I can't stop calling her
She's all I want and more

I, I've been listening to jazz
I called so many times
I swear she's going mad
