Recommended Videos If I learned anything from Red Clover, it’s that Billy Zane and leprechaun movies don’t mix – yet I still gave Scorned the good old college try. “But Matt, does that mean there are evil leprechauns in Scorned?!” No random commenter, even though a monster leprechaun might have presented SOMETHING interesting, but Scorned is written and directed by Leprechaun helmer Mark Jones – what could go wrong, right?!

Tens of millions of overwintering monarch butterflies can be found covering the tall pine and oyamel trees at the Reserva de la Biósfera Santuario Mariposa Monarca, the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Michoacán, Mexico. Conservation educator and naturalist Phil Torres visited this magical forest where monarchs gather in spectacular colonies from late October through February after migrating from the United States and southern Canada.
Some migrating monarch butterflies travel 3,000 miles, and up to 250 miles per day if the winds are right, to end up right here on my face.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Leslie Jordan Parents: Peggy Ann Jordan</h2><time>Jan 12, 2024</time>
