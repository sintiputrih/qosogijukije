I’ve been in a — I don’t know if I want to call it open, but open relationship, I guess,” she told her costars, denying that she would call it a “polyamorous” romance. “We just had a baby, we’re really happy. So I’m happy in my relationship now. He films for three weeks, OK, but then when he’s home, you’re seeing him every morning, every night.”</p><p>When questioned by her fellow realtors about how she sees him every night and morning when he’s “seeing other people,” Bre fired back, “I know that for me, I’m going to do what works for me and I really don’t care how anyone feels about it. … He makes his rounds.”</p><p>Bre jokingly compared Nick to Santa and couldn’t recall how many kids he was up to. “He definitely has super sperm because my child is brilliant,” she declared.</p><p>Prior to her romance with the actor, which began in 2021, Bre was married to <a href=#><strong>Johnny Manziel</strong> </a>from 2018 to 2019.</p><p>“I am not a monogamy kind of person,” she said on the Netflix show. “Everything I’ve ever seen is divorce and people are unhappy and it ends badly and the kids suffer and it’s, like, men can’t keep it together. It’s never us.”</p><p>The group began to question Nick more after Bre learned via the internet that he welcomed a baby with LaNisha.</p><p>“I don’t understand his motivation, you know, if he does love these women, why complicate it? It’s already complicated,” <a href=#><strong>Nicole Young</strong></a> said in a scene without Bre present.</p><p>“Maybe he’s a master manipulator and all of these women have fallen in love with him and he’s promised them a situation that he can’t keep,” <a href=#><strong>Chelsea Lazkani</strong></a> argued.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Chelsea went on to call it “disgusting” that Nick is creating “broken” homes, explaining: “There’s no amount of time in the day that would allow Nick to see those 10-plus babies and give them the love and dedication they need. Fundamentally, she’s being bamboozled.”</p><p>Selling Sunset season 6 is currently streaming.
