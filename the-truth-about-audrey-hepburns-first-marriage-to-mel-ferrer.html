After getting married, she had things other than work on her mind. Hepburn really wanted a family, something that she had missed growing up. Her father had abandoned the family when she was only 6 years old (via the <a href=#>Independent</a>). "I worshiped my father and missed him terribly from the day he disappeared. ... My mother had great love for me, but she was not always able to show it."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The couple experienced a lot of heartbreak before welcoming their son Sean in 1960. Hepburn had an earlier miscarriage and a stillbirth after a horse-riding accident on the set of the western "Unforgiven" (1960). Not long after her son's birth, Hepburn went to work on one of her most famous films, "Breakfast at Tiffany's." This proved to be a very popular film with moviegoers and critics and earned her an Academy Award nomination. Ferrer insisted that he didn't resent his wife's success. However, actor Robert Flemyng, a friend of the couple, said it did eventually get to Ferrer. "He was not pleased to be Mr. Hepburn," he said, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Express</a>. Other problems also ate away at the couple's relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDk3Bua3BfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZpiunKKaxm60xKmZrqqeqHqntdGsq2alkae%2Fqq3GnmStp12isq15xZ6pq52iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./plainfield-consolidated-school-district-202.html><span>←</span><span>Plainfield South High School - Plainfield</span></a>
