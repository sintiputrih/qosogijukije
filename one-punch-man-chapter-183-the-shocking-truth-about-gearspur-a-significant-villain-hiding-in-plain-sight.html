Some of the executives of the Hero Association come down to the basement and are immediately exposed by Eyelashes, who questions their motive. They play it off as if they don’t know who Tsukiyomi is, but it’s clear that they do since they were ready to sell psychos to Tsukiyomi. Gearspur enters the conversation and drops a bombshell, revealing that Tsukiyomi is a secret society that has been around for a long time. He speculates that the Survivor of the Monster Association decided to come back and take psychos under the guise of some kind of trade-off.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Read More: <a href=#>Black Clover Manga Chapter 358 Full Raw Scan + Plot Summary Leaked</a></p><p>Gearspur then reveals that he is an inside agent for Tsukiyomi, which is a significant villain hiding in plain sight, just like Drive Knight.
