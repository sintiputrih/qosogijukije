This was the second encounter between the two Welterweight fighters. The first fight – which did not count towards Koscheck’s official record due to the bout being considered an exhibition match for The Ultimate Fighter television taping – resulted in a split decision win for Sanchez. At the weigh-ins for the event, Sanchez shoved Koscheck during the traditional post-weigh-in staredown. Although Sanchez continued to shout at Koscheck, no conflict ensued. In their fight, Koscheck defeated Sanchez by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27). Koscheck outstruck Sanchez throughout all three rounds and only shot in for a takedown once. During his post-fight interview, Koscheck repeatedly exclaimed, “Nineteen-and-one,” in reference to Sanchez’ first mixed martial arts defeat (including the two fights from The Ultimate Fighter show). UFC President Dana White announced a few weeks after the fight that Diego Sanchez had an undiagnosed illness before and during the fight which turned out to be a serious staph infection.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Josh Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular MMA Fighter</strong>. Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Josh Koscheck celebrates birthday on November 30 of every year.</p><p align=justify>On November 21, 2009, Koscheck defeated Anthony Johnson by rear naked choke at 4:47 in the 2nd round. In the first round, Koscheck blocked a knee aimed at his head while he had two knees on the ground. Koscheck went to the ground holding his face, prompting the referee to step in and deduct a point from Johnson. Commentators accused Koscheck of faking the impact of the knee, which seemed to miss Koscheck’s face on the replays. Koscheck has said in multiple interviews that he was reacting to an eye poke, not the knee. In round two, Koscheck poked Johnson in the eye twice leading to Johnson being given time to recover. Because of this, many fans think due to the controversy in both rounds between the fighters, it should’ve been declared a No Contest. In his post fight interview, he called out Dan Hardy, the #1 contender in the Welterweight Division.</p><h3>Where is Koscheck now?</h3><p>Currently, Josh is still <b>involved in Mixed Martial Arts and is continuing to work to build and improve Check Defense</b>.
