After somehow keeping their initial series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, on the air for a baffling, 20 seasons, many of us thought we’d seen the last of Kim, Khloe, and the gang when the series ended in 2021. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How mistaken we were</a>.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Less than a full year later, the clan was back, this time in the succinctly titled The Kardashians. The 2022 series has already put out four seasons, premiering in April of 2022, September of 2022, May of 2023, and September of 2023. And Hulu, the show’s official streamer, clearly has faith in the family’s staying power, because there’s plenty more headed our way.</p><h2 id=h-will-there-be-a-fifth-season-of-the-kardashians data-injectable=false>Will there be a fifth season of The Kardashians?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Good news, you oddball Kardashian fans: At least two more seasons of The Kardashians are incoming.
