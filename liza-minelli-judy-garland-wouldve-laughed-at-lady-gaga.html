However, Minnelli revealed that she has not viewed the film’s trailers just yet.</p><p>While Minnelli remarked that star <a href=#><strong>Renee Zellweger</strong></a> is “a wonderful” actress, she still voiced her concerns with the <strong>Rupert Goold</strong>-directed feature — which is based on <strong>Peter Quilter</strong>’s musical drama, End of the Rainbow. “I just hope they don’t do what they always do. That’s all I’ve got to say,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bradley-Cooper-Lady-Gaga-A-Star-Is-Born.jpg><p>In May, Zellweger opened up about how she attempted to reach out to Minnelli about portraying the Arthur star’s mother.</p><p>“We have a really close mutual friend. One of my best friends, actually. And I had spoken with him about trying to find her,” Zellweger told <a href=#>USA Today</a>. “But, I guess I wasn’t successful in that.”</p><p>Judy will follow the late star’s life a year before her accidental overdose. The Zellweger-led film will open in theaters nationwide on&nbsp;September 27.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOispFiuqq6xKWjomWaqrG6ecaaqaWZnpl6uLvUpZuvnV2hrrazx56bZpmkYrmisNhmnpqfkWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./britney-spears-which-of-her-hits-did-she-actually-write-html.html><span>←</span><span>Which of Her Hits Did She Actually Write?</span></a>
