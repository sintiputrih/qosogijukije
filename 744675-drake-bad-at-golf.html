Throughout the past few weeks, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he has been in Turks & Caicos,</a> enjoying the sun as the Winter approaches. It has been a nice vacation for him as he cools out in his favorite spot.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As it turns out, Drizzy recently took a page out of the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DJ Khaled</a> paybook. In the Instagram post below, you can see that he took to the golf course to enjoy a round of the sport. As many of you already know, golf is a difficult and oftentimes frustrating sport. It can be hard to really break any ground, and for the most part, you can never really be consistent at it. Only the pros are getting consistent scores and hitting the fairway every time. Drake is well-aware of this, and he is very realistic about his skill.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-on-the-golf-course>Drake On The Golf Course</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I’m trash at this sport but the drinks are hitting," Drake wrote in his caption. Overall, the drinks are a huge reason to play golf. Furthermore, there is a social aspect to it as you usually play with a group of friends. Although you could have a rough round, being around your buddies does make the whole experience more palatable. Hopefully, with each round of golf that he plays, Drizzy gets at least a little bit better. After all, you don't want to be bad at the sport forever, especially if you hit the links often.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know your thoughts on golf, in the comments section below.
