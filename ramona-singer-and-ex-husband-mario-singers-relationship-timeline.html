For the first time I considered the possibility that there might be another woman and I asked him straight out if there was. He told me no and I believed him. After that, he gave me a letter in which he explained how unhappy he had been. I tried to understand where this was coming from because I felt that we had been happy all summer.”</p><p>In October 2013, one of Ramona’s friends confirmed to her that Mario seeing someone else.</p><p>“I remember walking along Park Avenue with one of my good friends, before going to therapy one day, and she said to me, ‘I hate to be the one to tell you this, but I think you need to know,’ she paused and then said slowly, ‘I think Mario has been seeing another woman.’”</p><p>She confronted him about the situation during a therapy session. “He looked like a deer in headlights,” Ramona explained. “’Just admit you were talking to a girl. Just admit it,’ I shouted. He snapped out of it and got defensive, ‘Yes, I was. Do you want to know what else I do with her besides talk?’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the twosome were on rocky terms following their split, they proved to be on good terms when t<a href=#>hey opted to self-quarantine together amid coronavirus concerns in March 2020.</a></p><p>“Self-isolating with Avery’s dad,” Ramona said in her daughter’s Instagram Story at the time. “He’s making dinner every night.”</p><p>Scroll through to revisit their relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkv6K5zqeYZquZo7SmvoyapZ1lla16qcHSm5innF2irrO1zmaqoqaXmr%2B0edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWStoZ2auaq6xGidnpqiqq6zxYxrZ2pwXWeDcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./omer-fedi.html><span>←</span><span>Omer Fedi Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</span></a>
