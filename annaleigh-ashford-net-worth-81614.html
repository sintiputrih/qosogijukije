However, it was announced that Ashford and her colleague, Michael Longoria, were no longer in the cast of the show. Publicists announced that it was a creative decision to remove large portions of dialogue from the show, therefore making their characters non-existent. Ashford was originally slated to stay in the production from its premiere in Chicago until sometime in 2010.</p><span>2010</span><p>In November 2010, Ashford was part of a reading of the musical <i>Carrie</i>. In December 2010, she participated in a "creative workshop" reading of the stage musical version of <i>Diner</i>, as Beth.</p><span>2011</span><p>In January 2012, Ashford ended her run playing Maureen Johnson in the Off-Broadway revival of <i>Rent</i>, which began July 14, 2011 and closed on September 9, 2012.

On May 11, 2016, <i>People</i> announced that Ashford and Tapper were pregnant with their first child, a boy. Ashford and Tapper's son, Jack Clark Tapper, was born on September 8, 2016.</p><span>2014</span><p>Beginning on August 26, 2014, Ashford played the role of Essie Carmichael in the Broadway revival of <i>You Can't Take It with You</i>, directed by Scott Ellis.

Ashford was not eligible for a Tony Award for this performance, as the production withdrew itself from any award competition, including the Tony Awards. A statement was released on February 3, 2016 saying: “The producers of <i>Sunday in the Park with George</i> will not be submitting Hudson Theatre’s engagement of this New York City Center production for awards eligibility. With a season so full of tremendous, soon-to-be long-running new musicals and revivals, the producers feel this extremely limited, special run stands most appropriately outside of any awards competition. The production is nevertheless proud to be part of such a landmark Broadway season.”</p><span>2017</span><p>On November 3, 2017, it was announced that Ashford would be making her New York Philharmonic debut in a televised New Year’s Eve concert celebrating the music of Leonard Bernstein.
