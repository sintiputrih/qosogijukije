Viewers are introduced to a fresh layer of complexity to their already intriguing dynamic.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brittani is dating a man named TJ.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@brittanicooper2000</span></figure><p>Meet the man causing ripples in the closely-knit world of Mary and Brittani. TJ has entered the scene, but the duration of his relationship with Brittani is shrouded in controversy. According to Brittani, they've been together for 2.5 years, but Mary, ever the watchful mother, vehemently disagrees and insists they have been together a mere one year, tops.</p><p>Interestingly, the show reveals a significant shift in the mother-daughter routine. Gone are the days of shared showers. This is a pretty big deal since they have been showering together since Brittani was 5 years old.</p><p>When Brittani says, “She doesn’t shower with me anymore. That’s one step.” TJ, says, “Thank God.” And he followed things up by saying, “I just think that’s cringey.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>However, some things never change. Brittani and Mary continue their tradition of sleeping in the same bed, which raises eyebrows when TJ is in town.</p><p>The trio finds themselves navigating the delicate balance between the unconventional and the norm. Mary's protective instincts clash against Brittani's desire for some independence.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Last season, Brittani opened up to her mom about being bisexual.</h2><p>In a surprising revelation last season, Brittani peeled back another layer of her life by disclosing her bisexuality to Mary.</p><p>Despite their exceptionally close relationship involving shared showers and colonic cleanses, Brittani chose to keep this aspect of her identity under wraps until recently. Viewers were taken aback by this revelation, especially considering how incredibly close she is with her mom.</p><p>As the sMothered saga unfolds, the love story between Brittani and TJ adds quite a bit of drama. With Mary's skepticism about the length of their relationship and Brittani’s desire for a little independence, viewers are left on the edge of their seats.</p><p>Will Mary fully accept TJ into the fold or will the tension surrounding their unorthodox traditions reach a breaking point? sMothered Season 5 promises an intimate exploration of love, family, and boundaries, leaving us hungry for more revelations about Brittani and TJ's relationship. Buckle up, folks — it's bound to be a bumpy and entertaining ride!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BqwNOapaJllJbBqrrGZqqmp6SdsrOxww%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./home-towns-ben-napiers-body-transformation-over-the-years-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Home Town's Ben Napier's Body Transformation Over the Years: Photos</span></a>
