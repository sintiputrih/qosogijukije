While Wallen and Swift are on fairly different music paths, they have more in common than their fans may like to admit. Wallen, a country music star, and Swift are both from Tennessee.</p><p>Although Swift pivoted into becoming the most influential pop sensation, her origin dates back to country music. However, the disparity between the pair is linked to their fans. In April 2024, <strong>Wallen’s fans caused quite an internet war after he name-dropped the “Cruel Summer” singer. </strong>The Swifties wasted no time swinging into action, leading to questions concerning Wallen’s relationship with Swift. This article will explore how Wallen’s words about Swift triggered his fans, as well as his rapport with the songstress within the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-morgan-wallen-and-taylor-swift-rsquo-s-fans-clashed-on-social-media>Why Morgan Wallen And Taylor Swift’s Fans Clashed On Social Media</h2><p>After one of his shows for his One Night at a Time Tour at Lucas Oil Stadium, Morgan Wallen made a ground-breaking announcement regarding his music. He revealed how the organizers informed him that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his concert was a record-breaker in the history of the stadium</a>. The music star stated:</p><p>“This is the single most attended concert in the history of this building, and we’re the first to do it for two nights in a row.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/morgan-wallen-singing.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A fan’s post on TikTok showed the singer celebrating that achievement with his multitude of fans. However, after Morgan Wallen shared the big news, <strong>he acknowledged Taylor Swift and her iconic star power</strong>. The “Wasted On You” singer quipped: “I’m going to say that until Taylor Swift comes to town.” Just as the “Cowgirls” crooner mentioned the pop star, the crowd received it with mixed feelings.</p><p><strong>While some of Wallen’s fans cheered for Swift, others started booing her.</strong> However, Wallen wasted no time quelling the uproar as he defended Taylor Swift. “We ain’t got to boo. We ain’t got to boo,” the country star added.

In response to what transpired between the “Spin You Around” singer and his fans, the Swifties had a field day defending their idol. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some of the “Willow” crooner’s fans accused Wallen of setting her up for criticism.</a> One person commented on X:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-10.jpg><p>“Taylor Swift has more class than you and your fans.

Drop Taylor’s name to get your name out there.”</p><p>Another angry Swiftie lashed out, “Morgan Wallen fans booed Taylor Swift last night in Indy. They will begin to cough in 3 days.” However other Swifties felt Wallen’s intentions were not malicious, as they praised him for standing up for her. They also relayed that Wallen’s fans were solely to blame for the controversy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One person mentioned, “ Love Morgan!

He’s acknowledging that she will dethrone him from that record. Greatness acknowledges greatness.

In 2021, <strong>Wallen made headlines as the first country music star after Swift to close the year with a best-selling album.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The disgraced singer, who had a tumultuous moment early in his career</a>, made history with his sophomore album, “Dangerous: The Double Album,” after selling over 3.2 million copies, according to 985 The Bull.

The star singer made this move after news got out that his former Panacea Records label re-released some of his songs against his wish. Wallen felt the re-released records were inferior to his newer and more successful songs. By re-releasing them himself, he hoped to overshadow the older songs by swaying fans to listen to the newer versions.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:05</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-many-songs-has-taylor-swift-written-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?">How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has penned plenty of hits, but how many songs has she actually written in total?</p><p><strong>Taylor Swift was the first to make this move when her former record label, Big Machine Records</strong>, was sold to music executive Scooter Braun. This meant that Braun had the right to the master recordings of all the music she created while under the label. Swift revealed that before the company sale, she “pleaded for a chance” to own her work, but instead, she was made to strike a bargain by signing another deal with the record label.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift revealed on Tumblr that she knew the former label owner, Scott Borchetta, would try to sell the company, ultimately leading her to take the highway. “I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta [CEO of Big Machine Records] would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future,” she stated.</p><p>The music star added that she learned of the change of ownership at the time it was publicly announced.
