Frances took that to mean painting her dad’s nails blue and giving him homemade jewelry to wear.</p><p>“It looks great!” cohost <a href=#><strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong></a> told Baccarin, before adding, “You are glowing by the way. I just want to say you are so glowing and radiant.”</p><p>The Deadpool star jokingly replied, “I think that date was pretty successful,” before standing up and showing off her growing baby bump.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ben-McKenzie-and-Wife-Morena-Baccarin-Are-Expecting-Baby-The-Talk.jpg><p>The actress spoke to Us Weekly in December 2018, when her daughter was 2 years old, saying <a href=#>she was not quite ready to expand her family</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Ask me in five years,” she told Us. “Honestly, these days, [date night is], like, a movie, a great meal, a nice conversation and connecting over just us.”</p><p>Baccarin and McKenzie tied the knot in 2017 after meeting on the set of Gotham in 2014. They <a href=#>welcomed their daughter</a> in 2016, the same year that they got engaged.</p><p>The Flash actress is also mother to 7-year-old son Julius, whom she shares with ex-husband <strong>Austin Chick</strong>.
