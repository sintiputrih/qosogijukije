DeMille Award for her contributions to film. For the virtual show, Fonda remained committed to her vow to reuse and recycle her wardrobe, opting to re-wear a sleek cream pantsuit with satin lapels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fonda's monochromatic outfit looked stunning with her silver hair, which served as her glam team's muse for the star's hair and makeup.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We wanted a touch of drama to complement her chic outfit," Fonda's hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jonathan Hanousek</a> tells Instyle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since Fonda is growing out her pixie, Hanousek added choppy layers and razored bangs for a "cool, shattered effect."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Fonda's cut did indeed bring the drama, her icy silver hair color is almost impossibly shiny. The stylist says the secret to glimmering silver or gray hair is an in-shower gloss treatment to enhance the hair color. Hanousek used <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">L'Oréal Paris' Le Color Gloss in Clear</a> on Fonda, who also serves as one of the brand's celebrity spokespersons, before styling her hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After prepping her damp, post-shower strands with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">primer</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">mousse</a>, he blow-dried and tousled the hair with his fingers for a lived-in vibe. The final touch was a spritz of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">L'Oréal's Elvive Dream Lengths Air Volume Dry Shampoo</a> to create lift, volume, and texture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for makeup, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>David Deleon</a> used neutral tones on the eyes, and rosy pink on the cheeks and lips. "I was really inspired by Jane's beautiful natural silver hair color," he tells InStyle. "It's such a striking and dramatic frame for the face."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With softness as the overall theme of the makeup look, Deleon says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">L'Oréal's Age Perfect Radiant Serum Foundation</a> was his key product of the night. "It has medium coverage, but a light texture and needs little to no powder to set," he adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And if you're wondering if there are any hacks for makeup application on mature skin, it's simply just to keep things simple. "A good hydrating moisturizer is key to prepping the face for foundation," Deleon shares. "Always go with a lightweight foundation; nothing too cakey or heavy for mature skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And that's how a beloved Hollywood icon does a red carpet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wLCYq5yjYrK3sc2tqmiqlZl6pK3RqZytZ5ekuaWxzWaepaeSmsBwtsCnnGaen6OxonnHmqCrZZ2WuKbBz2ZpaWphYrSwuMOepWafnKSvpr8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./star-wars-how-much-did-mark-hamill-make-to-play-luke-skywalker.html><span>←</span><span>'Star Wars': How Much Did Mark Hamill Make To Play Luke Skywalker?</span></a>
