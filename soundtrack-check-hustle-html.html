The choices feel too familiar and easy, like the soundtrack was assembled by someone who knew little of seventies and early eighties music outside of what they had seen on a Time-Life compilation infomercial.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bed850ca2e49530991395c16580d11a9-9-0-0@published data-word-count=2><strong>American Hustle</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b30/1fd/1702b8825b044dc77200dec6b7e70c8f47-17-anchorman-2.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bed850ca2e49530991395c16580d11a9-11-0-0@published data-word-count=80><strong>Best Uses of Music</strong></p><ul><li>Donna Summers’s “I Feel Love,” which plays when Agent DiMaso and Sydney dance together at a strobe-lit disco.&nbsp;</li><li>Elton John’s “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” which plays as everyone shows up in Atlantic City for the big con.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=#>Mayssa Karaa’s cover of Jefferson Airplane’s “White Rabbit,”</a> which plays as the gang and their faux sheik sits down with mobster Victor Tallegio.

(Or maybe, as <a href=#>critic Glenn Kenny writes</a>, Hustle is simply a series of mini-music videos: “Russell seems to deeply deplore the fact that karaoke had not caught on in America in the late ‘70s, or that he wasn’t able to configure the whole film as a musical, because he does love to let his actors sing, and when he can’t have them sing, he likes to cut to shots of them copping various attitudes while a particular song plays out, in full or something like it, over the soundtrack.”)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bed850ca2e49530991395c16580d11a9-15-0-0@published data-word-count=5><strong>The Wolf of Wall Street</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/a67/f7d/98893a8ea77407ec742d56d5048b7b92f3-10-american-hustle-beauty-15.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bed850ca2e49530991395c16580d11a9-17-0-0@published data-word-count=147><b><i></i>Best Uses of Music</b></p><ul><li><a href=#>Howling Wolf’s “Smokestack Lightning,”</a> which plays as Stratford Oakmont has its first bacchanal — the sound drops out and Howling Wolf’s (is the double Wolf too on the nose?) “woo-hoo”s drop in as a mess of strippers, strobe lights, and confetti fill the screen.</li><li><a href=#>Jimmy Castor’s “Hey Leroy, Your Mama’s Callin’ You,”</a> which plays following Jordan’s showstopping Steve Madden IPO speech to get his troops amped.

And to be sure, it has many more songs and cues than either <i>Anchorman 2</i> or <i>American Hustle</i>. (The fact that it’s three hours has something to do with that.) But at its best, the music is used as a propulsive, rhythmic element, driving the movie forward and linking scenes together — several songs stretch across different scenes, disappearing and then returning minutes later. <a href=#>Bo Diddley’s “Pretty Thing”</a> soundtracks the wild orgy on Jordan’s bachelor party plane, then vanishes, then comes back at the end of his wedding. <a href=#>7Horse’s “Meth Lab Zoso Sticker”</a> starts in the scene where Brad’s wife is getting money taped across her breasts, continues into the moments when she (and others) funnels money across the Swiss border, and continues into Brad and Donnie’s fight in the parking lot. <a href=#>Plastic Bertrand’s “Ca Plane Pour Moi</a>,” lends the Benihana bust scene (“Beni-FUCKING-HANA”) a punky, yet silly, energy.<b></b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bed850ca2e49530991395c16580d11a9-21-0-0@published data-word-count=4><b>So which is best?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-bed850ca2e49530991395c16580d11a9-22-0-0@published data-word-count=117>Look, Martin Scorsese is a music master, okay? (Remember the beginning of the paranoid Ray Liotta helicopter scene in Goodfellas, soundtracked by <a href=#>Harry Nilsson’s “Jump Into the Fire,”</a> or the <a href=#>“Be My Baby” opening from</a> Mean Streets?) Not only because his movies feature good music — and here, not a Rolling Stones song among the bunch — but also because it’s wide-ranging and complex. The Wolf of Wall Street could have gone for a wall-to-wall eighties and nineties soundtrack, but instead spread its selections over decades (Bo Diddley to Foo Fighters), styles (blues to hip-hop), and even languages. It’s nowhere as obvious as Anchorman 2 and has nearly none of the Zemeckis-lite, on-the-nose choices of American Hustle.<b><br></b></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Soundtrack Check: <i>Anchorman</i>, <i>Wall Street</i>, <i>Hustle</i></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobWdgZny0u9Snm62qkZi4bq%2FHnpqkZZiqwLW4xGefraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tina-knowles.html><span>←</span><span>Tina Knowles: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</span></a>
