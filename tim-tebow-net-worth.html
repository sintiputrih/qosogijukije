After an impressive college career at the University of Florida, Tim Tebow went on to play just three seasons in the NFL, two seasons with the Denver Broncos and one season with the NY Jets. He also had stints with the New England Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles, and Jacksonville Jaguars, and later switched his position to tight end in an effort to prolong his career. In 2023, Tim Tebow was elected into the College Football Hall of Fame.</p><p>In July 2023, Tebow became a co-owner of an ECHL hockey expansion team to be based in Lake Tahoe. He was previously a minor owner in the Jacksonville Icemen and Savannah Ghost Pirates.</p><h2 id=career-earnings><strong>Career&nbsp;</strong>Earnings</h2><p>During his time in the NFL, Tim earned a little under $10 million in total salary. During his time with the Eagles, Tim earned $4.1 million. As an Eagle, he made a grand total of eight passes. In other words, he earned $512,500 PER PASS.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Tim Tebow was born on August 14, 1987, in Makati, Philippines. His parents were Baptist missionaries who moved to the Philippines to build their own ministry. When Tim was three years old, the family moved to Jacksonville, Florida. He is the youngest of five children and they were all homeschooled by their parents. Despite not being enrolled, he was allowed to play on the football team of Trinity Christian Academy and later switched to Nease High School. He was named Florida's Player of the Year and led the team to a state title.</p><p>He enrolled in the University of Florida and Tebow played college football for the Gators, taking home the Heisman Trophy in 2007 and appearing on BCS National Championship-winning teams during the 2006 and 2008 seasons. After having what many consider one of the greatest college football careers ever, Tebow was selected by the Denver Broncos in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft. As a member of the Denver Broncos, he started the last three games of his rookie season and became the team's full-time starting quarterback beginning in the sixth game of 2011. The Broncos were 1–4 before he became the starter, but began winning with him on the field, often coming from behind late in the fourth quarter, until they won their first AFC West title and first playoff game since 2005, defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime. Tebow was traded to the New York Jets during the offseason after the Broncos acquired free-agent quarterback <a href=# title="Peyton Manning Net Worth">Peyton Manning</a>. Tebow received little playing time for the Jets and on April 29, 2013, the Jets released Tebow after drafting quarterback <a href=# title="Geno Smith Net Worth">Geno Smith</a>. He signed a two-year, non-guaranteed contract with New England on June 11, 2013, before being cut from the team on August 31, 2013.</p><p>During his time with the Broncos, Tebow became known for publicly acknowledging his faith in God by dropping to one knee in a pose that looked much like Auguste Rodin's bronze sculpture "The Thinker" after scoring or making a great play. The genuflecting, signature move was coined "Tebowing" and proceeded to be mimicked throughout the country. The origin of the phrase came from fan Jared Kleinstein, who posted a photo on Facebook of him and all of his friends mimicking the stance. Kleinstein went on to set up a website showing photos submitted by people around the world showing their own version of Tebowing. The site had 20,000 submissions and 20 million page views after just two months. Tebow legally trademarked the name.</p><p>In 2015, he joined the Philadelphia Eagles to compete for their third-string quarterback job. He was released after the preseason. He attempted a comeback to the NFL in 2021 when he reunited with coach <a href=# title="Urban Meyer Net Worth">Urban Meyer</a> and worked out as a tight end for the Jacksonville Jaguars. Again, he was released before the regular season.</p><p>On December 30, 2013, he was hired by ESPN as a college football analyst.

Tebow has raised money for Shands Hospital pediatric cancer center in Gainesville and a trip to Disney for disadvantaged children. In January 2010, Tebow launched the Tim Tebow Foundation. The foundation announced plans to build a children's hospital in the Philippines in 2011. The Tebow CURE hospital in Davao City opened in 2014 and specializes in orthopedics. The cost of the project was $3 million and came from donations from CURE and the Tebow Foundation. The foundation also throws Night to Shine, which is an event that holds a prom for disabled teens so they have a safe place to attend prom.
