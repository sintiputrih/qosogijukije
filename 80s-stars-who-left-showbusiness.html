Johnny Depp is a prime example; He started as a heartthrob in the TV show 21 Jump Street and quickly became one of the most successful actors of his generation. But not every star who was big in the '80s has stayed in the spotlight. Fame is fickle and tiring, and these stars from the decade of Ronald Reagan, leg warmers, Alf, and scrunchies, have opted out after making it big.</p><p><strong>Updated on May 5, 2023:</strong> Many stars of the 80s are indeed making a rise as nostalgia is being capitalized in current entertainment. Among all the stars on this list, however, there are only two that have publicized their plans to continue their craft in 2023. Tiffany Darwish is still touring this year, performing her music, and Rick Moranis will be acting in an upcoming film called Shrunk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=haviland-morris-became-a-real-estate-agent><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Haviland Morris Became A Real Estate Agent</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/haviland-morris-in-sixteen-candles.jpg><p>One will most likely recognize Haviland Morris as Caroline Munford from Sixteen Candles. She was also in Gremlins 2, a few Madonna music videos, and other projects, but the iconic John Hughes film has always been her biggest claim to fame.</p><p>After slowing down her career in the 1990s and 2000s, opting for roles in shows like Law and Order and films like Home Alone 3, Morris has focused her energy on becoming a real estate agent. She does, however, continue to appear in 1–2 episodes of various television shows every few years, her most recent being Bull in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=phoebe-cates-is-loving-family-life><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Phoebe Cates Is Loving Family Life</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/phoebe-cates-in-gremlins.jpg><p>Phoebe Cates became an icon thanks to her bikini scene in Fast Times At Ridgemont High, a scene that without a doubt got replayed to the point of wear and tear on many rented videos. Cates retired after marrying actor Kevin Kline in the 1990s. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She then opened a high-end boutique</a> named Blue Tree and has been its owner and operator ever since.</p><p>Cates did return to the screen briefly in 2001 for a role in the indie comedy The Anniversary Party as well as lent her voice for the video game Lego Dimensions in 2015.

The film is considered by many to be one of the best horror films ever made, although it is detested by King.</p><p>Lloyd only did one other film before quitting acting, a TV movie about Watergate conspirator G. Gordon Liddy. He did, however, return to the screen very briefly for a cameo in the movie Doctor Sleep, the 2019 sequel to The Shining. Lloyd is now a biology teacher in Kentucky.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How 'The Lost Boys' Actress Jami Gertz Became A Billionaire</a></span></p><h2 id=tiffany-darwish-is-still-performing-her-music><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Tiffany Darwish Is Still Performing Her Music</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tiffany-darwish-i-think-we-re-alone-now.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tiffany Darwish, better known to her fans just as "Tiffany," became a pop sensation and an apt idol for the era thanks to the attention she garnered by touring her music at shopping malls.

The pop star is still performing and touring, however, and in 2021 went viral (briefly) during a show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for cussing out a fan</a>.</p><h2 id=jeff-cohen-is-now-a-licensed-attorney><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jeff Cohen Is Now A Licensed Attorney</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ke-huy-quan-sean-astin-josh-brolin-corey-feldman-and-jeff-cohen.jpg><p>No one is a 1980s fan unless they have seen The Goonies. The film features an array of notorious 1980s stars, and among them is Jeff Cohen, who played the lovable, truffle-shuffling Chunk in the adventure comedy.
