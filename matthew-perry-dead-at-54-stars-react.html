What a great guy, so sad.”</p><p>Before his death, Perry <a href=#>candidly discussed the ups and downs he faced</a> after rising to stardom on <a href=#>Friends</a>. The sitcom, which ran from 1994 to 2004, <a href=#>made Perry a household name for his role</a> as Chandler Bing. Behind the scenes, however, Perry battled addiction after a Jet Ski accident in 1997.</p><p>Perry became addicted to Vicodin, which eventually led to alcohol abuse. In 2000, he was hospitalized with pancreatitis and ultimately <a href=#>started detoxing while still filming Friends</a>. Over the years, Perry made multiple attempts to get sober. His struggles inspired Perry’s decision to open a sober living home for men in 2013.</p><p>After entering recovery, Perry <a href=#>detailed his journey in his memoir, Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“So much has been written about me in the past. I thought it was time people heard from me. The highs were high, the lows were low. But I have lived to tell the tale, even though at times it looked like I wouldn’t. And it’s all in here. I apologize it’s not a pop up book,” he tweeted ahead of the book’s release in November 2022.</p><p>Scroll down to read tributes to the late star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqLA06GcsGWgmr%2BzxYydnJqcXZbBboGTZqqtmaKoerOxwJyraA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./j-pat-o-malley.html><span>←</span><span>J Pat OMalley</span></a>
