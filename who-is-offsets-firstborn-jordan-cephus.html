The Migos rapper recently revealed that he and Cardi B are trying to work things out for the sake of their daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kulture Kiara Cephus</a>, however, that isn't the only issue the rapper is currently dealing with. The "Bad And Boujee" rapper underwent a series of paternity tests after one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his many former girlfriends</a>&nbsp;stepped forward claiming he was the father to her son, Jordan Cephus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Offset denied these allegations, it turns out he is, in fact, the father! After nearly a decade of being apart from his son, Offset has ensured that he remains a stable figure in his children's life. Despite it taking a hot minute, things managed to work itself out, and Offset has since been reunited with his son for two years now, but who is Jordan?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Cardi B And Offset: A Timeline Of Their Rocky Relationship" href=#>Cardi B And Offset: A Timeline Of Their Rocky Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-jordan-cephus>Who Is Jordan Cephus?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Offset has been a respected member of the music industry for quite some time! The Migos rapper, who first stepped out on the scene back in 2008, has found himself in the hot seat more times than he'd wish for. Although Offset has proven himself to be a great dad with his children Kulture, Kalea, Kody & Jordan, it appears as if things started off roughly for Offset when his former girlfriend, Justine Watson, came forward claiming that Offset was the father of her child.</p><p>The "Bad & Boujee" rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">immediately denied any and all allegations </a>that claimed he was the father of 8-year-old, Jordan Cephus. This came up around the exact same time that Offset had proposed to Cardi B on stage during one of her performances, which couldn't have been better timing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Breaking Down Cardi B And Offset's Combined Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The public doesn't know much about Justine Watson,&nbsp;however, that didn't stop her from wanting to be heard! Offset's former girlfriend revealed that he has not been present in Jordan's life and has not contributed financially whatsoever. For this reason,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Watson&nbsp;is seeking retroactive child support</a> from Offset and sought out over $15,000 in attorney bills, all of which she insisted be paid for by Offset himself.</p><p>Despite the two having quite a difficult start, it appears as if Offset finally agreed to a paternity test that later confirmed he was, in fact, the father. It took no time for Offset to welcome Jordan Cephus into his life. The soon to be 11-year-old has not only appeared in Offset's album cover but has become an active member of the Cephus family. Offset posts shots of all of his kids, including his eldest Jordan, hanging out, proving just how tight-knit they all are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cardi B has also welcomed Jordan into the family with open arms, posing in several pictures with her hubby's eldest and celebrating his birthdays over the last 2 years. It's no secret that Offset and Justine Watson had quite a grim start, but the duo currently co-parents Jordan and have been for nearly 2 years now.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>21 Facts Cardi B And Offset Don't Want Fans To Know About Their Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuu8Wfqp6so2Kzqr7SrZmoqp5it7C%2Bw5qlZpuVpbW2v44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-bake-in-the-party-chocolate-barbie-tiktok-trend-song-and-lyrics.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Bake In The Party Chocolate Barbie TikTok Trend?
