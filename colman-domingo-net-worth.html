Anyone following Colman’s career these days, however, can tell he’s on his way to earning double, maybe triple that amount very soon.</p><p>After giving several captivating performances in 2023, including The Color Purple and as the late openly gay activist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayard Rustin</a>, Colman quickly launched into A-list status.

I need you to see me without limitation. I want you to see me as an artist, as a thinker, as a creator.”</p><p>“In the middle [of both of these characters] is me who’s just constantly trying to explore Black men and how we operate, how we love, whether there’s redemption or not,” he continued. “There’s a human quality that I’m trying to explore in all these different kinds of people, whether they’re a pimp or a bandleader.

Before he would go on to win an Emmy for his role as <a href=#>Ali in Euphoria</a>, Colman said he nearly quit acting in 2014.</p><p>The actor explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> that he was forced to rethink his career after losing a role he felt would be his big break. He said he auditioned to play a maitre’d in HBO’s <a href=#>Boardwalk Empire</a> but didn’t get selected because of his skin color.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After auditioning for the role, Colman said his agent told him that a researcher on the project said he didn’t fit the profile of a maitre’d because he wasn’t light-skinned.</p><p>"That's when I lost my mind," Colman recalled of the rejection, telling his agent, “I can't take it anymore. I think this is going to kill me."</p><p>Despite his initial yearning to quit acting, Colman kept going and, almost a decade later, blossomed into the star he was always meant to be.
