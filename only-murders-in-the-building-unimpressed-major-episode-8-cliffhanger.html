While Mabel and Charles are on hand and instantly go to help him, the episode ends on a huge cliffhanger, with Oliver’s fate left unknown - and fans are not impressed.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Only Murders in the Building ends in major cliffhanger</figure><p id=ejbAyALYqyQ data-wc=46>Sharing a gif of Jennifer Lawrence repeatedly saying "what do you mean?!", one person wrote: "That ending!

While some fans had already worked out the potential theory that Loretta was actually Dickie’s mother, Ben’s adopted brother who worked as his long-suffering assistant, it turns out that their suspicions were correct, and that Loretta had kept clippings of articles and photographs seemingly of Ben, but all featuring Dickie.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=e1mv6CK1P9Ag data-wc=84>In the episode, Dickie was about to be taken away by the police, leading Loretta to confess to Ben’s murder instead, but fans still do not think the mother and son duo did it. One person wrote: "I don't think it's Loretta. Might be Tobert but what's his motive? I feel like Dickie might have done the first attempt and someone else finished the job when Ben was found to be alive or maybe the other way around? I kind of suspect Donna now."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/747cf12433a3-martin-short-omitb.jpg><p id=eLUNZJpoouUJ data-wc=70>Another fan added: "Well it's clear that Loretta did not do it, I doubt Dickie did it either. i really think it's Tobert idk why. ALSO THE TRIO IS BACK." Another person added: "What if Dickie THINKS he did it, told his mom “Loretta” so she’s covering for him thinking he did it but actually we will find out in the last ep that it’s Tobert."
