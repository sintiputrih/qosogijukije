Taylor Swift’s fan base is so loyal now that some of them have been sporting adult diapers to the singer’s Eras Tour so as not to miss a precious moment from her three-hour concerts, according to the people on TikTok.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Tiktok.</p>Enable All Media<p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Tiktok.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Now don't me wrong, we love a good concert and we realize they aren't the cheapest nowadays (not least a Taylor Swift one), but lingering in our own piss and poop so we can listen to Shake It Off one mile away from the stage isn't my idea of fun.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Swifties – as Taylor Swift's loyal following is collectively known – are a different breed of fan. They discuss Swift's every move online, they dissect her videos, and comment on every second of her life. They, to be frank, are dedicated to the cause.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Twitter post.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Nevertheless, for many, the decision to wear diapers isn’t a last minute one.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Back in March, @therealkatherine revealed her plan to purchase an 18-pack of adult nappies after successfully obtaining tickets to Taylor Swift’s instantly-sold-out Eras Tour.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Crazy that anyone is willing to volunteer that kinda info publicly but, luckily (for her, at least), she's apparently not the only Swiftie diapering up, not by a long shot.</p><p>Your Highsnobiety privacy settings have blocked this Tiktok.</p>Enable All Media<p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Taylor Swift has been making headlines since her Eras Tour started on March 18, and not always for the reasons you’d probably expect.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">For one, there was the crazy drama around Ticketmaster sales, which eventually got Swifties to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">take the entertainment giant</a> to court.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Then, following Swift’s split <a href=#>from boyfriend Joe Alwyn</a> in April, the singer was suddenly seen <a href=#>cavorting around with</a> divisive 1975 singer Matty Healy.</p><p class="paragraph___RlNzb paragraph-paragraph10___NmvOh contentParagraph___u9L2Q paragraph___bcvQh">Drama about Swift and Healy has been inescapable ever since — Are they actually dating?
