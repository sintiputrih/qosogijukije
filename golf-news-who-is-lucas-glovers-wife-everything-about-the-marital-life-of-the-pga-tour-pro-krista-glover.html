Everything About the Marital Life of the PGA TourPro</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>American Professional golfer Lucas Glover turned pro in 2001. He currently plays on the PGA Tour. </span><span>His first win on the PGA Tour was in 2005, when he triumphed at the Funai Classic at the Walt Disney World Resort. </span><span>In 2009, he surprised everyone when he won the US Open at the Bethpage Black Course. </span><span>He won by two strokes over <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Phil Mickelson</a>, David Duval, and Ricky Barnes. </span><span>His victory strengthened his legacy. </span><span>In 2011, he again showed his charisma and won the Wells Fargo Championship by defeating Jonathan Byrd.</span></p><p><span>This year, he has been doing pretty well. </span><span>In the Rocket Mortgage Classic, he tied for fourth place. </span><span>And in the John Deere Classic, he tied for sixth place. </span><span>The 43-year-old Glover is currently leading in the Barbasol Championship by two shots, at the end of the second round on Friday. </span><span>With a total of seven professional wins, Glover is definitely one of the finest players. </span><span>But he is not handling all this alone; there is another person who is his constant support system: his wife. </span><span>Let’s learn more about her!</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Meet Lucas Glover’s beautiful wife</h2><p><span>Glover married Krista Wakefield in 2012. </span><span>After the marriage, she took Glover as her last name. </span>Details of their relationship before marriage and where they tied the knot are unclear. Glover and Krista both welcomed their first child, Lucille, in 2013. In 2015, they welcomed Lucas Jr. into the family.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-golf-news-despite-etching-his-legacy-at-the-four-million-event-liv-golf-cameron-smith-reveals-the-staggering-sleepless-nights-before-joining-the-defector-league?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago1025199482h.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Despite Etching His Legacy at the $4 Million Event, Cameron Smith Reveals the Staggering ‘Sleepless Nights’ Before Joining the Defector League</p></a><p><span>Krista Glover was born in Greenville, North Carolina. </span><span>She is Jay and Christina Wakefield’s child. </span><span>She is very active on social media. </span><span>Her Instagram account (@chicmeetsweststyle) has over 10,000 followers. </span><span>She is into fashion and design. </span><span>She also routinely gives beauty hacks as well. </span><span>Krista also endorses many brands online, like Givenchy and Dolce & Gabbana. </span><span>Her fashion sense is top-notch. She is one of the golf community’s most fashionable wives</span><span>. </span><span>One can spot her in high-class fashion societies and fashion weeks.</span></p><p><span><br>Not only Krista, but Glover is also very active on social media. </span><span>He never misses a chance to show his love and devotion to his beautiful wife on social media. </span><span>You can always see him bragging about her on Instagram.</span></p><p><span>Their relationship remained pretty much hidden from the prying eyes of the media. </span><span>However, one incident in 2018 could have strained their relationship.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Trouble in Glovers’ paradise, shocking details emerged</h2><p><span>A family violence allegation led to Krista’s detention in 2018 during the Players Championship. </span><span>Reportedly, there was an argument between Krista and Glover’s mother. </span><span>For this, Krista served a night in prison. </span><span>She was later released on $2,500 bail.</span></p><p><span>According to Golf Week, Krista agreed to complete 25 hours of community service after admitting to substance abuse. </span><span>Later, Glover made a statement on Twitter and referred to it as a ”private matter”.</span><span><span> </span>“On May 12, my wife and mother were involved in an argument to which the police were called. Everyone is fine. Regrettably, although Krista was charged, we are comfortable that the judicial system is able to address what actually happened and Krista will be cleared in this private matter. We thank you for respecting our privacy as we work through this unfortunate situation,” tweeted Glover.<br></span></p><p><span>There is always a tough ordeal that every marriage has to go through. </span><span>It depends on the parties involved how they handle it. </span><span>Some don’t pass through the storm, while others do and strengthen their relationships. </span><span>Fortunately, the Glovers belong to the second category.</span></p><p><span>Everything is fine now, and both of them have gone from strength to strength since then. </span><span>They also renewed their wedding vows. </span>“It was the closure of everything, of all the mess for us and a symbol of a new beginning,” Glover said. “It was emotional and symbolic.”</p><p><span>They have grown stronger each day thanks to Krista’s consistent support and Glover’s unshakable commitment to their relationship. </span><span>This is most apparent in their journeys. Due to their shared experiences, mutual understanding, and strong sense of camaraderie, Lucas and Krista have developed an unbreakable bond. We really anticipate seeing their lovely connection grow even more in the future.</span></p><p><strong>Watch this story-&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>“I Would Retire”: Moments After The Extraordinary Proposal by LIVGolf, Rory Mcilroy Leaves No Stone Unturned To Reveal His Seriously Hard Feelings</a></strong></p><p>What do you think about this beautiful couple?
