And welcome to the Week 2 waiver wire live blog! I'm Jay Felicio, filling in for Michael Salfino, which means a little less lovable acerbic wit and a little more fart jokes. Just a little. Lots os fantasy stuff to get to, so we'll see.</p><p>You're going to see a lot of Puka Nacua the next 24 hours. A lot. Either the world telling you to pick him up (rightfully so) or analysts taking victory laps because they "recommended" him... among 300 other players.</p><p>So sit back, relax, <a href=#>drop your questions here</a> (if you have them), and let's get rocking and rolling as we prepare our bids and waiver wire order for Week 2 (and beyond)!</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">WRs to replace Skyy Moore</h2><p><strong>"WRs to target after Skyy Moore's awful showing? have Tutu Atwell on my bench is he the play against the Niners next week?" - Joey R.</strong></p><p>I would start Tutu over Skyy next week, but check waivers for obviously Puka Nacua, but also Kendrick Bourne, Rashid Shaheed, Jakobi Meyers, and Nico Collins to name a few.</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Brandin Cooks vs. Courtland Sutton</h2><p>"Brandin Cooks or Courtland Sutton?"- Dan B.</p><p><strong>Russ is COOKING AGAIN! Sutton.</strong></p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Dropping Rashod Bateman</h2><p><strong>"Do you drop Bateman for Nacua as a bench stash? Also Zach Moss for Joshua Kelley or Kyren Williams?" - Steve P.</strong></p><p>Bateman for Nacua is tough, but I’d make the move. I’d drop Moss for either of them, with Ekeler banged up I’d target Kelley first.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">The upside of Rashid Shaheed</h2><p><strong>"Should I use my waiver priority to pick up Rashid Shaheed and drop Skyy Moore?"- Vincent C.</strong></p><p>I would. Similar upside, and Shaheed has a much clearer path to consistent targets. Tale as old as time, you just can’t trust a Kansas City wide receiver.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">How much FAAB to put on Jakobi Meyers</h2><p><strong>"Should we expect Jakobi Meyers to continue to be Jimmy G's favorite target? What FAAB percentage should I spend on him, if so?"- Ben S.</strong></p><p>As long as Davante Adams is a Raider, I expect him to be Jimmy G’s top target. However, Meyers should continue to be heavily involved and he’s worth the pickup. As far as FAAB percentage, I’d drop somewhere in the 10-12% range.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Ranking Puka Nacua, Kendrick Bourne and Rashid Shaheed</h2><p><strong>"How would you rank Puka Nacua, Kendrick Bourne and Rashid Shaheed?"- Garrett G.</strong></p><p>Puka</p><p>Shaheed</p><p>...</p><p>....</p><p>....</p><p>....</p><p>Bourne</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">The slow starters to scoop up</h2><p><strong>"Every year managers dump rookie and handcuff players early after they don't produce the first couple of weeks. Which slow start players should we be looking to scoop up?"- Steve P.</strong></p><p>GREAT question. A few guys who didn’t have a great Week 1 I like long term are Zach Charbonnet, Quentin Johnston, Jonathan Mingo, Sean Tucker, and Michael Wilson.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Is Tyler Allgeier a difference-maker?</h2><p><strong>"Had a strong week with McCaffery and Tua. But RB is a concern for me. Conner is my RB2. Our WW is a bid system with $100 for the season. Should I go big on a FA like Allgeier? The 4 cut options on my bench are Dillon, Kyren Williams, Elijah More and Elijah Mitchell." - Anonymous</strong></p><p>I would attempt to pick up Allgeier, but I wouldn’t go all in on him. Bijan Robinson is still the RB1 on this team and while the Falcons are going to run, run, and run some more, Allgeier is a flex play at best unless something were to happen to Bijan. You go all in for difference makers, and Allgeier isn’t one.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Picking up Puka</h2><p><strong>"I have third in waiver priority, should I go after Nacua or K Williams? I would drop Mims or Kirk. I also have J Cook, Bijan Robinson, Bigsby, Spears at RB and AJ Brown, Dotson, Mims, Kirk and Flowers at receiver" - Mark D</strong></p><p>I’d go for Puka and drop Mims.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">The Joe Burrow Bounceback</h2><p><strong>"Is Joe Burrow bench-able for week 2? Should I grab Stafford, Carr or one of the rookie QBs for Week 2?" - Lucy H.</strong></p><p>No way I’m benching Joe Shiesty. I expect him to bounce back in a big way next week.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Some love for Hayden Hurst</h2><p><strong>"In desperate need of a TE. Chig Okonkwo's 2 targets are not encouraging. Which TEs are worth targeting? Looking at Hayden Hurst, Hunter Henry, Jake Ferguson, or Dalton Schultz." - William F.</strong></p><p>Hayden Hurst for sure. I don't expect him to see 7 targets every week, but he and Bryce Young have a connection and he should continue to be involved in the Panthers passing game. That’s all you can ask for from a non-elite TE.</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Is David Montgomery a must-start now?</h2><p><strong>"I went Zero-RB and feel like I'm juggling 4 RB2 candidates: -Cam Akers -David Montgomery -Khalil Herbert -Samaje Perine I'm leaning towards starting Montgomery over Akers in week 2 but not sure if it's too early to bench Cam?? Feel like Herbert and Perine aren't quite RB2 level" - Ben F.</strong></p><p>Of those four, Monty is a must start. He’s in the best offense of the group, and while I expect Jahmyr Gibbs to get more touches as the season goes along, I expect both Detroit backs to be heavily involved. While Kyren Williams' usage was disappointing for Akers, he still saw 22 carries. I’d roll Cam out another week and see what things look like after that. Herbert is unstartable until we see him get more than 8 carries, he may have already lost his job to Rochon Johnson.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Start Zay Flowers over DJ Moore?</h2><p><strong>"Should I be concerned about DJ Moore? And do I start Zay Flowers over him next week?"- Ryan R.</strong></p><p>Concerned? Maybe a little. Moore only seeing two targets doesn’t exactly instill confidence. I wouldn’t panic yet, but I would bench him in favor of Zay Flowers next week. Flowers lived up to the hype Week 1 with 9 catches for 78 yards and looks the part of WR1 for the Ravens.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Picking a flex from Rhamondre Stevenson, Miles Sanders and more</h2><p><strong>"Who should be in my flex spot from this list below? Rhamondre Stevenson, Miles Sanders, Gus Edwards, Nico Collins Leaning Sanders." - Scott H.</strong></p><p>It’s close between Stevenson and Sanders for me. I like Nico as well, but I’m going with Stevenson here. He’s got a matchup with a Dolphins defense that gave up 158 combined yards and a touchdown to have a lot more points scored than Carolina vs New Orleans (who scored a combined 26 points in Week 1).</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Kenneth Gainwell waiver priority</h2><p><strong>"Drop both Zeke and Ford for two of either Gainwell, Kelley, Williams, R.Johnson or J.Hill?" - Juan W.</strong></p><p>I’d drop both and put in waiver claims in the following order: Gainwell, R. Johnson, Williams, Kelley, Hill.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">How the Philly backfield will shake out</h2><p><strong>"How much do you trust that the Eagles will keep using Gainwell so much more than Swift & Penny?" - Gary S.</strong></p><p>I trust the Eagles running back usage week-to-week as much as I trust a squirrel with my Wi-Fi password.. Gainwell is definitely worth the pickup, but he could see his usage scaled back this week. He saw a career high in snaps, touches, is dealing with a rib injury, and has a short turnaround versus the Vikings on Thursday Night Football.</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Treylon Burks vs. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine</h2><p><strong>"How clear is it that Nick Westbrook-Ikhine is going to see a higher usage rate than Treylon Burks? Would you drop Burks for Westbrook-Ikhine?" - Stephen D.</strong></p><p>It was certainly frustrating to see Westbrook-Ikhine out-target Burks 7 to 3, but I would still hang onto Burks. His ceiling is much higher. Don’t forget, due to a knee injury in training camp Burks’ Week 1 status was in doubt. He should see more work as he continues to get healthy.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Holding onto Rachaad White</h2><p>"Drop Rachaad White for Joshua Kelley, K Williams or Sean Tucker?" - Brad P.</p><p>I would hang onto White over all three, unless word comes out that Austin Ekeler is going to miss extended time due to his ankle injury.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57y6KtnmWSobyov46wmKKulad6uLXRnmSwnZWgenN7k4SFp5qAi6CMn6OlZnKZZYeaqYDVhIl8jF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-kayla-leonard-meet-the-childhood-love-of-darius-leonard-513530-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Kayla Leonard?
