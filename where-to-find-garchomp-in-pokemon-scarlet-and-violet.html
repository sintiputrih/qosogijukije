<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Where to find Garchomp in Pokmon Scarlet and Violet</h1></header><section class=post-content>Recommended Videos<p>Known as one of the most powerful Pokémon in the franchise, Garchomp is a catchable creature in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. You don’t necessarily have to capture its lower evolutions since you can find it in its final form if you know its location. With the help of a bit of exploration using Miraidon or Koraidon, players will easily get their hands on a Pokémon that will always be a part of their squad. So, here is where you can find Garchomp in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.</p><h2>How to catch Garchomp in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/24110354/Pokemon-Scarlet-and-Violet-Garchomp-Pokedex-Map-850x478.jpg><p>If you have ever fought a Garchomp before, you might see that the Pokédex will not tell us where we can find this amazing Dragon-type. In a way, the Pokédex hints at where you can find it if you look at the location of the question mark. The place where you can find Garchomp in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is around the Great Crater of Paldea. If you have&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">defeated all of the Titans</a>, you can now climb any mountain and jump high, which should allow you to climb up the crater and walk around on top of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/24110351/Pokemon-Scarlet-and-Violet-Garchomp-Location-850x478.jpg><p>Players will see, if they walk around the edge of the crater, two very powerful Pokémon flying around: Garchomp and Magnezone. Each Garchomp you will find around the crater in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will have at least level 55 and can be easily caught with enough resilience. You can see the Garchomp flying in the image above.</p><p data-injection=true><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Where to find Cryogonal in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a></p><p>To catch a Garchomp in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you can use Dragon, Ice, or Fairy-type Pokémon to combat it. Though you might be scared that you will knock it out, if you wander around the crater enough, you will find a lot of Garchomps. So, attack it without restraints, as it is very powerful and can easily knock your whole team out. It likes to use a lot of Ground-type attacks, so using a Pokémon that levitates would also be very good in attempting to catch Garchomp in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/219bde662204c739af680162eb57cea0?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Adrian Oprea</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Based in London, United Kingdom, Adrian Oprea is a Guides Writer.
