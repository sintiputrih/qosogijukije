This means that you attract many admirers. So, you can afford to choose those that are fun, open-minded, and as adventurous as you are.</p><p>You try to avoid any type of romantic attachments as much as possible. You love your freedom, and you will go to any lengths to protect it. Of course, this means that you often get to disappoint your lovers.</p><p>The stars indicate that you will fall madly in love at some point in your life. When this happens, even you will not be able to control your passion for your lover. They will become the center of your universe. Everything you do and say will be about them.</p><p>Watch out for uncontrolled fits of jealousy at this time.

This will happen when you fall in love with a person who mirrors your qualities.</p><p>Such a person would have to be passionate, creative, charming, fun, and open-minded.</p><p>These qualities are prominent in people born under the Taurus, Cancer, and Scorpio zodiac signs.
