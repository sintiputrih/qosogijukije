It’s a story about heartbreak. It’s a story about love. It’s a story about betrayal. And, most of all, it’s a story about a young kid’s determination to survive.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Tom also admitted in the interview that his role in The Crowded Room altered his perspective on mental health. <span>“Learning about mental health and the power of it, and speaking to psychiatrists about Danny and Billy’s struggles, has been something that has been so informative to my own life,” he said. He hopes that people have “respect and more sympathy for people who are going through mental health issues” after watching the series.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>The Crowded Room Cast</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>Tom Holland</strong> stars as Danny Sullivan in The Crowded Room. The<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Spider-Man: No Way Home</a> revealed to EW that he had been “on the prowl” for a project that was similar to 1996’s Primal Fear. After creator and executive producer <strong>Akiva Goldsman</strong> pitched the show to Tom, the actor signed on as the star and an executive producer without seeing one official script.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Akiva, who won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for A Beautiful Mind, noted that Tom was the “first and only person” he spoke to about playing Danny. “He took this character to heart. It was an unbelievably challenging piece,” the showrunner told EW. “We shot 130 days in a row. In New York. During COVID. And Tom held the center of it in a way that makes the piece work because he’s so compassionate and compelling and his conviction in the role is extraordinary. I’m excited for him because I don’t think people have seen him this way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Crowded-Room-The-Cast-Apple-TV-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Shameless and Angelyne alum <strong>Emmy Rossum</strong> plays <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Danny’s mom</a>, Candy.
