She has some interesting tips on how other parents can achieve the same status.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@tamrastark886</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">This mom has figured out reasons why she's the hangout house and offers advice to other parents.</h2><p>In late July 2023, Tami (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@tamrastark886</a>) spoke about how her home became the hangout house for her son and whatever kids he was loosely associated with at the time. She had apparently heard from other parents who wanted the same status for their own homes.</p><p>"There is never just one teenager at my house," Tami claims in her video. "There is either six or 12 or 18 or 24. It's like they only travel in packs and when another group shows up, there's several of them that show up."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tamrastark886 href=#>@tamrastark886</a><p>Hot cheetos bring all the boys to my yard!</p><a title="♬ original sound - Tami" href=#>♬ original sound - Tami</a></figure><p>Tami then broke down the top reasons why kids always hang out at her house. For one, she's labeled herself "the <a href=#>snack</a> queen." She admitted that while she picks up some fruit and small snacks to present some healthier options, she often stocks up on the greasy chips, junk food, and sugary drinks that kids crave.</p><p>Tami also revealed that she doesn't necessarily set too many ground rules for kids who come over. Doors have to be open for whenever boys and girls are present in the home and there's no alcohol available to the children either. Other than that, Tami simply lets the kids do their thing without hovering too much.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@tamrastark886</a></figure><p>Tami presents her TikTok as sort of an informative video for other parents based on her own experience. She mainly addresses "people that want to see their kids more often."</p><p>"You just need to lighten up the reins a little bit," Tami advises. "Make yourself scarce and make sure there's really crappy food in the house." At least you'll know where you child is.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tamrastark886 href=#>@tamrastark886</a><p>Replying to @mrs_tee79</p><a title="♬ original sound - Tami" href=#>♬ original sound - Tami</a></figure><p>It may not be super great advice for parents who want to make sure their kids are making healthy food choices, but folks appreciated the tips that Tami presented.</p><p>One person in the comments section revealed, "My mom would always ask why she wasn't the hangout house but did nothing to make anyone feel welcome."</p><p>Another person wrote, "That's the trick. Be open and don't look for problems. They are safe in your house."</p><p>One TikToker even proved Tami's point in the opposite direction, writing, "My parents always tried to be the hangout house, but then they would get furious when anyone broke one of the 1,000 rules they have."</p><p>Tami's not like a regular mom, she's like a cool mom who sets up a safe but welcoming environment as a hangout house expert. She has learned over time what works for her and her son. It's important for kids and teens to have safe places to hang out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyuedGemKynnqh6tLTErGStoJVitaK6xqisrWWYpMK0sQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kendall-jenner-to-make-acting-debut-on-hawaii-five-o-2012188.html><span>←</span><span>Kendall Jenner to Make Acting Debut on Hawaii Five-O</span></a>
