He just needed a play-by-play announcer to pair with John, and “there weren’t any young up-and-comers” from which to choose.</p><p>So he tapped Cris, who was then working in Football Night in America, to “begin a crash course in learning how to be a play-by-play announcer.”</p><p>Even though Cris thought Dick had “lost [his] mind,” he gave the play-by-play role the ol’ college try. He practiced alongside Merril Hoge, and then worked with Madden during a Patriots-Broncos playoff game in January 2006. But in the midst of that game, Dick found out that ABC/ESPN was willing to let Al out of his contract. So Dick snapped up Al, and Cris ended his brief run as play-by-play announcer. And then, in 2009, Cris became Sunday Night Football’s color commentator after John retired.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans seem glad Cris stuck to his color commentator role.</h2><p>After Pro Football Talk reported on that anecdote from Dick’s book, social media users expressed their relief that Cris and John never teamed up as play-by-play announcer as color commentator, respectively.</p><p>“This would’ve been terrible,” one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>.</p><p>“Dodged a bullet there,” another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>.</p><p>And a third person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, “What a horror show that would have been.”</p><p>Yes, the shade is real when it comes to Sunday Night Football fans, although one Twitter user at least <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave Cris faint praise</a>: “I honestly think Cris is a pretty good second voice, but he would have been a disaster as a play-by-play.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGScqpmoeqS7y6Wgp6unpL%2B1tA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ariana-grande-husband-dalton-gomez-relationship-inspired-songs-on-positions.html><span>←</span><span>These Songs On Ariana Grande's 'Positions' Reveal The Truth About Her Relationship With Husband Dalt</span></a>
