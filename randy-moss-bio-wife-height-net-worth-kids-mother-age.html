Despite being a pro wide receiver, he also returned kicks and penalties for the team and played free safety.</span></p><p><span>In 1994, at the age of seventeen, Rand Moss received the Kennedy Award for West Virginia Football Player of the Year.&nbsp;In fact, a year later, Moss was named to Parade magazine’s annual All-American high school football team, and fourteen years later in 2009, he was named one of the 50 Greatest High School Football Players of All Time.&nbsp;Back at DuPont, Moss played alongside Bobbie Howard, who is now linebacker for the Chicago Bears.&nbsp;Aside from sports, Randy excelled in other areas, back in high school.&nbsp;He was also on the school’s debate team.&nbsp;DuPont is one of two schools that have merged to form Riverside High School.&nbsp;By the time Moss graduated from high school, he had 44 football touchdowns, 109 catches and 2,435 yards under his belt.</span></p><h2><strong><span>career</span></strong></h2><p><span>After high school, Moss was awarded a scholarship to Notre Dame University;&nbsp;play on the school team.&nbsp;Unfortunately, before he returned to college, Moss was involved in a racially motivated brawl.&nbsp;He was given a 30-day suspended sentence, after which he pleaded guilty.&nbsp;The University of Notre Dame had therefore revoked his scholarship.&nbsp;After leaving prison in 1996, Moss transferred to Florida State University but was soon transferred to Marshall University, where he excelled at football and set several records, including “most consecutive games with a touchdown catch, most TD passes obtained by a freshman caught and most yards obtained were won by a freshman.&nbsp;“</span></p><p><span>Randy Moss helped the college team through an unbeaten season, winning the national title in the school’s final season in Division I-AA.&nbsp;Despite this, Mos’s success was stifled by bouts of cross-country fighting and his violent outbursts.&nbsp;Which caused him to be transferred from team to team.&nbsp;Between 1998 and 2005 he played for the Minnesota Vikings, where he held a record 17 touchdown receptions.</span></p><p><span>In 2005, Moss left the Vikings for Oakland Raiders, where he reportedly underperformed and failed to improve the team’s already poor condition.&nbsp;In 2007 he joined the New England Patriots where he made a critical comeback.&nbsp;With the Patriots, Moss had one of his best seasons in NFL history.&nbsp;He posted 1,493 yards and led an NFL record of 23 touchdown receptions.&nbsp;However, his achievements were still marred by behavioral flaws.&nbsp;He is said to have splashed a match officer with a water bottle and even pushed a traffic cop with his car.&nbsp;In February 2012, he signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers.</span></p><p><span>After leaving the 49ers, Moss became an analyst for Fox Sports 1’s Fox Football Daily Show. In June 2014, he was called to Victory Christian Center High School in Charlotte, North Carolina as an assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.&nbsp;His son Thaddeus attended the same school and played football.&nbsp;In July 2016, Moss became an analyst on the ESPN shows Sunday NFL Countdown and Monday Night Countdown.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>With thousands of hours in the field, Randy Moss has not only made a name for himself, but good luck as well.&nbsp;As of 2019, sources state that his net worth is over $25 million.&nbsp;Although it is not known how much he earns annually.</span></p><h2><strong><span>wife, children, mom</span></strong></h2><p><span>Randy Moss and his former girlfriend LibbyOffutt have four children – Sydney, Senali, Thaddeus and Montigo.&nbsp;Taking after his father, Thaddeus played football for Boone County High School, St. Albans High School, and Lincoln High School.&nbsp;He was then posted to Victory Christian Center High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father became assistant head coach in June 2014.</span></p><p><span>Thaddeus also played a tight end for the NC State Wolfpack 2016 and in April 2017 Thaddeus announced his transfer to Louisiana State University.&nbsp;Mos’s first child, Sydney, is an NCAA Division III Thomas More College basketball player.&nbsp;Where she also sets records like his father;&nbsp;including highest score in 2014 NCAA Division III tournament.&nbsp;After splitting up with Libby Offut, Randy married Lydia Moss.</span></p><p><span>Aside from her name, there are no verified details about his mother, including livelihood and the circumstances that led to Moss and his father’s distant relationship.</span></p><h2><strong><span>height and body measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>Randy Moss, now in his forties, maintains his strong, muscular build.&nbsp;He stands 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 meters) and weighs 210 pounds (95 kg).&nbsp;He has black hair and dark brown eyes.&nbsp;However, we have no information on shoe size or body measurements.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiqkaOxunnMqKqsZZKevG7DyJ%2BcZqCVnrSpwIynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMpKCdq12ivLW0xKtkmp%2BVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./savannah-brinson.html><span>←</span><span>Entrepreneur and Furniture Designer Savannah Brinson Married NBA Player, Savannah Brinson.
