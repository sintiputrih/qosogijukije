Colin bashed Abe’s head in with a rolling pin so that Colin could enact his revenge on Paulina Price (Jackee Harry). Luckily, Colin was stopped but Abe’s very survival was in question for several days. After life-saving surgery, Abe eventually woke up. But he couldn’t quite remember much of his own history. He knew who he was but that was just about all.</p><h3>Days Of Our Lives Spoilers – Abe Carver Disappeared!</h3><p><a href=#>Abe was treated at the hospital by a nurse named Whitley King (Kim Coles)</a>. Whitley looks similar to Paulina so Abe mistook the nurse for his wife. Whitley, who recently lost her own husband, seized the opportunity to spirit Abe out of the hospital. Pretending to be Paulina, Whitley told Abe that Colin was still after him and that he needed to leave with her immediately. Abe went with Whitley, leaving the real Paulina and the rest of Abe’s family to worry frantically for his safety. Knowing they would never stop searching for Abe, Whitley made it look like Abe was dead.</p><h3>Days Of Our Lives Updates – Abe Carver Is Quite Suspicious Of Whitley King</h3><p>Abe already knew he had a son named Theo Carver (Cameron Johnson), Whitley convinced neighbor boy Jerry Prentiss (Terrell Ranson Jr) to visit Abe and pretend to be Theo. Abe was confused but Jerry managed to allay those fears somewhat. But Abe is certainly uncomfortable and still believes something isn’t quite right. He’s been having flashes of memory but nothing concrete has yet come back to him. But all of that could change now that the real Theo ran into Whitley at the police station.</p><p><img alt="Days Of Our Lives: Theo Carver (Cameron Johnson)" width=800 height=467 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/07/days-of-our-lives-dool-spoilers-abe-remembers-everything/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Days Of Our Lives (DOOL) Spoilers: Abe Remembers Everything!" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DOOL-Theo-Carver.jpg></p><h3>Theo Carver Will Find His Father!</h3><p>Eli Grant (Lamon Archey) told Theo that Whitley was the last person that was known to have <a href=#>seen Abe before he disappeared</a>. But when Eli questioned Whitley, there were discrepancies in her story. Look for Theo to get a hunch and follow Whitley back to her home. Once Abe catches sight of his real son, look for his memories to come flooding. But will Whitley become so desperate to keep Abe for herself that she will become violent?</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>Will Jerry’s guilt get the better of him? How much longer can Whitley fool Abe? Will Theo find his father and jog Abe’s memories back? Anything can happen in Salem so stay tuned to Days of Our Lives streaming every weekday on Peacock. <a href=#>And don’t forget to check back right here regularly for all your Days of Our Lives news, information and spoilers!</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX90e49wZp2Zqah6sLKMqKyrZZyew6a%2FjJ2mqKRdqL2wtcueqaxlkZeybr7EppymmpWnwG6x1Z6psqyYnruoew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-schwimmer-returns-to-social-media-supports-ex-wife-zoe.html><span>←</span><span>David Schwimmer returns to social media to show support for ex-wife Zo with rare message</span></a>
