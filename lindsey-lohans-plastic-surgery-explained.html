In fact, on constant has been speculation that Lohan has gotten subtle work done throughout her career to maintain her youthful appearance. Though no one is expected to look the same from ages 18 to 37, many people believe that nature has the help of a needle or two.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@tomtop10s href=#>@tomtop10s</a><p>Replying to @Ivyü§ç Lindsay Lohan through the years <a title=lindsaylohan href=#>#lindsaylohan</a> <a title=freakyfriday href=#>#freakyfriday</a> <a title=meangirls href=#>#meangirls</a> <a title=lindsaylohanedit href=#>#lindsaylohanedit</a> <a title=hollywood href=#>#hollywood</a> <a title=thenvsnow href=#>#thenvsnow</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=makemefamous href=#>#makemefamous</a> <a title=glowup href=#>#glowup</a> <a title=beforeandafter href=#>#beforeandafter</a> <a title=nowvsthen href=#>#nowvsthen</a> <a title=viralvideo href=#>#viralvideo</a> <a title=trending href=#>#trending</a> <a title=blowthisup href=#>#blowthisup</a> <a title=nostalgia href=#>#nostalgia</a> <a title=nostalgic href=#>#nostalgic</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Stars Are Blind - Paris Hilton" href=#>‚ô¨ Stars Are Blind ‚Äì Paris Hilton</a></figure><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>The first procedure that many tabloid writers and even some medical professionals believe Lohan has done is a rhinoplasty, more affectionately known as a nose job. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mirror UK spoke with </a>a surgeon from MYA Cosmetic Surgery back in 2019 to see whether slight differences in Lohan‚Äôs nose could indicate that she had some work done.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>The surgeon noted that the slimmer shape of Lohan‚Äôs nose alongside the subtle lift and slope of its tip suggest that Lohan may have gone under the knife to achieve her current look. Aesthetic Nurse and TikTok creator Sarah Louise has also noted in a video that she believes the slight differences in slope and width on Lohan‚Äôs nose mean that the changes probably didn‚Äôt occur naturally.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@sarahlouise.sla href=#>@sarahlouise.sla</a><p>What cosmetic procedures has @lindsaylohan had done? üíâ <a title=lindsaylohan href=#>#lindsaylohan</a> <a title=theparenttrap href=#>#theparenttrap</a> <a title=plasticsurgery href=#>#plasticsurgery</a> <a title=lipfiller href=#>#lipfiller</a> <a title=nosejob href=#>#nosejob</a> <a title=rhinoplasty href=#>#rhinoplasty</a> <a title=celebrities href=#>#celebrities</a> <a title=celebrity href=#>#celebrity</a> <a title=transformation href=#>#transformation</a> <a title=beforeandafter href=#>#beforeandafter</a> <a title=fy href=#>#fy</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Aesthetic - Tollan Kim" href=#>‚ô¨ Aesthetic ‚Äì Tollan Kim</a></figure><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true>Most of the other procedures that Lohan receives speculation are far less invasive. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mirror UK reported </a>that experts believe the fullness in Lohan‚Äôs cheekbones may be a result of dermal fillers in her cheeks. Dermal fillers are injectable implants that create a soft, smooth look to the skin. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Life & Style has speculated</a> that recent photos in which Lohan‚Äôs skin looked particularly smooth may have been a result of filler or Botox as well.</p><p data-characters=518 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Nurse Sarah Louise took to TikTok to speculate on some other procedures and injections that created the Lindsay Lohan we see today. The fullness, definition, and hydration of Lohan‚Äôs lips in comparison to their shape from earlier years indicate some use of lip filler, according to Sarah Louise. She also believes that Lohan has had some filler put in her chin. She says that Lohan‚Äôs chin hasn‚Äôt changed or lost balance as she‚Äôs aged, which means she may have had some help keeping it as it is.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lindsay Lohan (@lindsaylohan)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>Despite constant speculation about the amount of work Lohan has done or what exactly she‚Äôs doing to her face, many people believe that in recent years, especially since becoming a mother, Lohan has been toning it down on the amount of filler and Botox that she gets done. Lots of people are praising her more natural, toned-down look. Especially after the late 2010s hysteria over her shocking transformation.</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>Lohan herself has never confirmed or denied any use of fillers, surgery, or botox to achieve her look. In recent years she‚Äôs been keeping a more private life, but even as a young person, she would never comment on what she had or hadn‚Äôt done to her face, although it‚Äôs been a topic for decades.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nestig (@nestigbaby)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>Regardless of constant scrutiny and speculation, Lohan is unbothered and thriving. She made a guest appearance at the 2024 Mean Girls premiere, and you may even see her for a minute or two in the movie. She often takes to social media to showcase her latest red-carpet looks or promote brand deals. She has her podcast, The Lohdown, where she interviews celebrity guests, and her own baby and nursery collection with Nestig Baby. Needless to say, the 2000s icon has too much going on to worry about media speculation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lindsay Lohan (@lindsaylohan)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>Regardless of anything the media says, fans are hugely supportive of the comeback that the 37-year-old has made over the past several years.
