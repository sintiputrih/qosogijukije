Instead of following someone else's eating rules, he eats at regular times every day on his own schedule. He believes that eating when hungry is the best way to eat because it allows you to choose what you eat rather than having someone force food down your throat against your will. He also believes that eating enough calories will allow you to lose weight efficiently without having to starve yourself.</p><p>The senior football advisor has been eating this way for many years, and it has helped him undergo weight loss without feeling constantly hungry, deprived, or tired.

It was intense, with weight training and cardio, but it was not for beginners. It took him about three months to get into the swing of things. Patricia began by adding some weights to his arms and upper body. Then he added weights to his legs and back, which significantly improved his strength and endurance. Matt noticed that his clothes were fitting looser than they used to after about six months of working out regularly every day, even though he was still dieting regularly.</p><h2>Meet Matt Patricia's wife, Raina Patricia!</h2><p><strong>Matt Patricia </strong>married<strong> Raina Patricia</strong> in 2009, and they have come a long way since then.
