The world may have lost a bright soul, but as Carl and Betty, his grieving parents, express, Heaven has gained an angel, and they find solace in that truth. At the ages of 95 and almost 97, they exhibit a strength that speaks volumes about their resilience. I recently spoke with both Carl and Betty, and listening to Betty reminisce about Jimmy is both heartwarming and heartbreaking.</p><p>She reflects on how Jimmy taught everyone around him the true essence of love, leaving an indelible mark on their lives. Despite the profound sadness, Carl urges us not to dwell on the loss but to celebrate the wonderful life Jimmy lived. My memories of Jimmy flood back, especially the days we spent together in Terre Haute at the Indiana Special Olympics State Games. Our adventures in “tent town” for new glasses stand out, a testament to his vibrant spirit. Jimmy’s dedication to the games was unmatched – an incredible 50 years of participation.</p><p>His impact extended beyond, touching the hearts of the Madison County Special Olympics family. The pain of Jimmy’s departure is felt not only locally but also resonates with the LA Dodgers Adult Fantasy Camp family. As we bid farewell, I can’t help but think of the joyous reunions awaiting him with old friends like Tommy and Vin. Jimmy, you will be sorely missed, but your legacy of love and perseverance will live on in our hearts. Until we meet again, say hello to Tommy and Vin for me.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKKZorq6ecSrqqShnpp6sK7Irayaqqlirq%2BwxKuqqKZdnrultcCnmGaimaK6unnEq6qkoZ6aeqmt0mabop2UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-momsen-boyfriend-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Is Taylor Momsen Single Or Taken?
