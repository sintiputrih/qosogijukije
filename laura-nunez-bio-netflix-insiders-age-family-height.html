But here’s the twist. All of them are already on the show!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As seen over the trailer, the contestants look terrified at times. Mind games, manipulation, and every ugly side of humans are revealed in this unique series.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This season, Laura Núñez was joined by 11 other participants namely Tatiana, Estefania, Barbara, Nicole, Ivan, Hugo, Peter, Fama Marong, Ivan, Olaya, and Francisco.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>They each fall into easily digestible archetypes, and that is what made the show so interesting. It might be shocking to reveal them and uncomfortable to every heartfelt and cringy moment, but let’s be honest, this is what the viewers come back for more.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Insiders</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was released on October 21, 2021, for viewers across USA and Spain. However, it was only later accessed by audiences of other counties.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Excited to be on the show, Laura took it to her IG on October 5 to write, “The secret ends here! Premiere on October 21 #insiders @netflixes.” (translated from Espanol to English)</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><strong>Spoilers Alert:</strong> Though Laura didn’t win the show, she won the heart of a lot of viewers and garnered a lot of fans. A comment on her IG wrote, “THE TRUE WINNER, I’m glad we can see you in the second season.”</span></p><h3><strong>Are Laura Núñez And Peter Base Dating?</strong></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The first we saw Laura Núñez on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Insiders</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, she admitted that was “selfish” and a bad listener, but she made up for her flaws by being honest and authentic. She shared that she was single for a long time, and wouldn’t mind meeting someone new on the Netflix original.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And there appeared <a href=#>Peter Basse</a>. He was sly and strategic and first approached Laura with a completely different mindset. But all that went out of the window shortly after he realized that Laura was just his type.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Peter wanted to focus on his tactics and observe others. So, he tried this best to keep his distinct from Laura and even gave her the cold shoulder. Unfortunately, nothing works when you’ve already fallen for someone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Though at first, it seemed like Peter was using Laura, it eventually became clear that they both liked each other. The two even went on to share a kiss after making it to the final week. What’s surprising was the sly and strategic guy, sacrificed himself to ensure that Laura would be in the running to win.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Unfortunately, Laura couldn’t make it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Laura and Peter’s relationship on the show was what viewers might label idyllic. The duo perfectly complemented one another and would make a successful real-life couple as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Peter, he won without winning because he found someone he wanted in his life forever.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, are they still dating? Well, as of October 2021, the duo remained silent about their relationship status. Maybe they did not want to reveal their private life, or just were waiting for a perfect opportunity to surprise their fans. If you ask us, it might be safe to assume that Laura Núñez And Peter Bass were still together.</span></p><h3><b>Laura Núñez Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Laura Núñez was 25 years of age in 2021 when first appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Insiders</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She is a year older than her romantic interest Peter.</span></p><h3><b>Laura Núñez Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Laura Núñez stands tall at a height of 5 feet 4.5 inches (164 cm).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mentioning her distinct features, Laura has beautiful blond hair, blue eyes, and a triangular face.</span></p><h3><b>Is Laura Núñez On Instagram, Facebook?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, as of October 2021, find her over Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>lauranunezcalvo</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> with 5.8K followers.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sadly, we couldn’t find her Facebook account.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Has Laura Núñez said Anything About Her Family?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Laura Núñez kept her personal life private.
