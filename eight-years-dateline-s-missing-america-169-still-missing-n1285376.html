The 24-year-old has been missing ever since. Erin had moved to Alaska the year prior and was working as a nanny. Her sister, Stephanie, told Dateline that Erin left for her date on July 1 with David “Dave” Combs, a man whom Stephanie said Erin had met a few nights earlier at a local bar. They drove to the Girdwood Forest Fair, and according to witness statements to the Alaska State Troopers, Erin was last seen at a beer garden with her date before they left around 6 p.m. In a statement to authorities in 1995, Dave Combs said they walked to his car, but the lights had been left on and it would not start. He told Erin he would walk to a nearby friend’s house for help. He said he walked for about two hours, but was unable to find his friend’s house. When he returned to the car, he said Erin was gone. He told authorities he figured Erin returned to the fair. Combs said when he tried to start the car this time, it worked. He stated he went back to the fair and searched for Erin until about 1 a.m. Lieutenant Randy McPherron, who is the sole investigator in the Alaska State Troopers’ Cold Case Investigation Unit, told Dateline in 2019 they haven’t received any leads in several years, but said he would follow up on any that come in. He added there are no suspects in Erin’s disappearance but said they have attempted to reach Dave Combs multiple times for questioning. McPherron told Dateline in 2021 that there have been no updates in the case. Erin’s sister, Stephanie, started a Facebook page<a href=#> FindingErinMarieGilbert</a>, where she continues to post regularly. At the time of her disappearance, Erin was described as 5’5’, 145 lbs, with brown hair and hazel eyes. She would be 50 years old today. Anyone with information about Erin’s case is asked to call the Alaska State Troopers at 907-428-7200 or Lt. McPherron at 907-269-5611.</p><p><strong>Anesha “Duffy” Murnane</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Anesha “Duffy” Murnane, 38, was last seen on security video on October 17, 2019, leaving her Homer, Alaska apartment heading to a 1 p.m. doctor’s appointment. She never made it. Police said security cameras captured Duffy leaving the Maintree Apartments on foot around 12:15 p.m. In the video, Duffy is wearing a blue jacket, light blue shirt and blue jeans. For weeks, law enforcement, assisted by K-9 units, searched the area where Duffy was known to frequently travel by foot. Duffy’s family told Dateline that she did not own a car and usually walked everywhere she went. According to Homer Police Department Lieutenant Ryan Browning, search dogs tracked Duffy’s scent into downtown Homer but then lost it, reaching a point search-dog handlers call a “car pick up.” Duffy’s mother, Sara Berg, says the family believes someone picked her up in a vehicle and that she has been abducted. She added that there has been no activity on Duffy’s bank cards and her phone battery was dead at the time of her disappearance. Sara filed a presumptive death petition for her daughter in April, 2021. On June 17, 2021, a six-member jury decided that Duffy can be presumed dead and also determined that her death was a homicide. According to online court records, Homer Superior Court Judge Bride Seifert issued a death certificate for Duffy on June 25. Her parents have long believed that she was murdered, but say they were still surprised to learn her death was a homicide. According to a June 23 press release, Homer Police consider Duffy’s case to be active and under investigation. Police continue to urge people to call the department if they think they’ve had any contact at all with Duffy or have any information about her whereabouts.</p><p>“‘Any contact with her’ means just that, anything at all,” the press release stated. “Even seeing her at some type of event without actually speaking with her, walking somewhere or in a vehicle could prove helpful.” Anyone with information about Duffy’s whereabouts should contact the Homer Police Department at 907-235-3150 or Crime Stoppers at 907-283-8477.</p><p><strong>Doren Sanford</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Doren Sanford was in Fairbanks, Alaska to look at some property that he was interested in purchasing when he went missing on August 28, 2020. He was last known to be in the area of Airport Road where he was searching for his lost Rottweiler, Groot. Both are now missing. Doren, who was 34 at the time, was raised in Tok with his large extended family, and lived in Anchorage where he worked as a heavy equipment operator/laborer. He had recently started his own business, Sanford Home Repair & Remodel. Lieutenant Jess Carson of the Alaska State Troopers told Dateline in March that they continue to look for Doren and believe that finding Groot may lead to more answers on Doren’s whereabouts. He added that troopers suspect foul play in Doren’s disappearance and believe they’ve already spoken to people who know what happened to him. The Alaska State Troopers have been working closely with the Village Public Safety Officers, the Fairbanks Police Department, the FBI, The Tanana Chiefs Conference, and the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Initiative. Doren is described as being 5’10” tall, weighing approximately 140-160 lbs, with brown hair and blue eyes. A Facebook page “<a href=#>Find Doren Sanford</a>” has been created to share developments in the case. If you have any information on Doren’s whereabouts, please contact the Alaska State Troopers (907) 451-5100. A $10,000 reward is being offered by the family for information that leads to Doren.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Najib ‘Jubi’ Monsif</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Najib ‘Jubi’ Monsif, 20, was last seen by his father around 2 a.m. on September 23, 2021, at their home in Scottsdale, Arizona. Later that morning, his father discovered Jubi was gone. Jubi has autism and is described as having the mental capacity of an 8-year-old. His belongings were left at home and he did not have a cell phone with him. Jubi’s family says it’s unusual for him to leave the house on his own and believes he was lured out of the house. They are offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads to his whereabouts. Jubi is described as being 5’10”, about 100 lbs, with a thin build. He was most likely wearing all black clothing and moccasins when he went missing. Anyone who believes they have an immediate sighting of Jubi should call 911. Anyone with information about Jubi’s whereabouts is asked to contact the Scottsdale Police at 480-312-5000.</p><p>UPDATE: Jubi’s <a href=# title=https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/missing-in-america/remains-found-mesa-canal-pump-station-identified-missing-arizona-man-n1285974>remains</a> were discovered on December 7, 2021, in Mesa, Arizona. Scottsdale Police say there are no apparent signs of foul play.</p><p><strong>Alicia Navarro</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Fifteen-year-old Alicia Navarro was last seen at her home in Glendale, Arizona, in the very early morning hours of September 15, 2019. When her parents woke up, she was gone and had left a note for them that read, “I ran away. I will be back. I swear. I’m sorry.” Alicia’s laptop was also gone, but the chargers were left behind in her room. Her mother, Jessica Nuñez, told Dateline in 2020 that she is especially worried because her daughter is on the autism spectrum and is known to be shy or anxious in some social situations. Alicia takes medicine and has a compromised immune system and Jessica has been worried that her daughter’s anxiety may have overwhelmed her amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Glendale Police Sgt. Randy Stewart told Dateline it was not known if Alicia was lured away or if she left on her own, but they were continuing to search for her and said they could use the public’s help for new information. The Glendale Police Department is working with the FBI and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children on the case. Officer Tiffany Ngalula, spokesperson for the Glendale Police Department, told Dateline last month that investigators have received and investigated at least 300 tips since 2019, and continue to receive at least four or five tips a week via social media and phone calls. A Facebook page called<a href=#> Finding Alicia Navarro</a> has been created for anyone wanting to discuss the case or provide information that may lead to her whereabouts. Alicia has brown eyes, brown hair. She was 4’5”, weighed 95 lbs, and had braces at the time of her disappearance. She may have been wearing a sweatshirt, a whitewash denim overall skirt and black and white Vans-type sneakers and carrying a silver Apple MacBook Pro laptop. If you have any information on Alicia’s whereabouts, call the Glendale Police at 623-930-3000.</p><p><strong>Daniel Robinson</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On June 23, 2021, 24-year-old Daniel Robinson, drove his 2017 blue Jeep Renegade with Arizona license plate NLA2CMA as he left his job site in the desert area west of Sun Valley Parkway just north of Cactus Road in Buckeye, Arizona. He hasn’t been seen or heard from since. Investigators said a ping was established on his cell phone but no location data was available due to the phone being off or out of range. It did not appear he'd made any calls or texts after leaving the work site. After graduating from the College of Charleston in South Carolina in 2019, Daniel was hired as a field geologist for Matrix New World Engineering and moved to Phoenix. He oversees sites located in remote desert areas and often works in extreme conditions, and travels long distances for projects. For months, multiple searches were conducted, but there was no trace of Daniel. In October, Daniel’s Jeep was discovered by a rancher in a ravine on his property about four miles southwest of the jobsite where he was last seen. Police say the Jeep appears to have rolled and landed on its side. Several of Daniel’s belongings were found at the scene, including clothes, his cell phone, wallet, and keys. A ground search was conducted, but nothing was found. In November, human remains were found in the search for Daniel, but were determined to belong to another missing person. Daniel’s father, David Robinson, who traveled cross country to search for him, told Dateline he will not leave Arizona until he finds his son. “It seems like it is simple, but when you are actually on the ground looking, it takes time,” he said. “You know, even with the people that we have it takes time... it’s a lot of time, effort and money to keep things going and I get weary at times that it is going to fade eventually and I won’t have that kind of support anymore, but like I said, as a father my drive is to find my son so I will do whatever it takes to make it happen.” Daniel is described as being 5’8” tall and weighs about 165 lbs. He has black hair and brown eyes. Daniel is missing part of his right arm from the forearm down. Anyone with information on Daniel’s whereabouts is asked to call the Buckeye Police at 623-349-6400 or the Buckeye Police tip line at 623-349-6411.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Brad Allen</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Brad Allen, 38, was last seen in the early morning hours of July 18, 2017, on his family’s property in Fountain Hill, Arkansas. Brad’s girlfriend, Megan Coady, told Dateline in 2018 that she and Brad had gotten into an argument the night before and he told her he was going on a walk through the woods to cool off. But when she woke up later that morning and Brad hadn’t returned home, Megan grew concerned. After a few days of searching, the family called authorities to report Brad missing. Police tell Dateline they have interviewed Brad’s family, friends and coworkers, but there are no persons of interest at this time. Foul play is suspected in Brad’s disappearance. If you have any information on Brad’s whereabouts, please contact the Ashley County Sheriff's Office at (870) 853-2040.</p><p><strong>Brooke Allensworth</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Brooke Allensworth was last seen on July 12, 2018, a day after getting her hair and nails done at a salon in Independence County, Arkansas. She was 37 years old. According to NBC affiliate KARK, Brooke’s father reported her missing on July 26 to the Searcy County Police Department, as Brooke lived in Searcy County at the time. On July 27, police in Independence County got a call that a vehicle registered to Brooke was found under a bridge. Some of her personal belongings were found inside the car. There was no sign of a struggle. A Facebook post by the Independence County Sheriff’s Office said police spoke with “several individuals” who had contact with Brooke in the days preceding her disappearance. Though no information led them to Brooke’s whereabouts, tips started coming in from multiple counties and the case was transferred to the Arkansas State Police Department. There have been no updates in her case. Brooke is described as being 5’8” and weighing 180 lbs. If you have any information on the circumstances surrounding her disappearance, please call the Arkansas State Police at (501) 618-8000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>The California Five</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Despite active pursuits on social media for many years now, the families of five young men who went missing in the San Francisco, California area over the past decade still have few answers. Jackson Miller, missing May 15, 2010, Cameron Remmer, missing October 6, 2011, Shawn Dickerson, missing December 2, 2011, Crishtian Hughes, missing February 7, 2013, and Sean Sidi, missing May 21, 2013, all vanished from various areas of San Francisco without a trace. On March 26, 2021, a possible sighting of Jackson Miller at a Target in Woodland, California shined a new light on the cases. A woman called the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office and reported that she had been approached by a man who identified himself as “Jackson” and stated he was a missing person and asked her for a ride. She declined and he left. According to <a href=#>Oxygen.com</a>, the National Center For Missing And Exploited Children has since conducted a forensic cross-analysis of the Target surveillance images. The results came back “inconclusive," John Bischoff, vice president of the Missing Children Division, said. Leads and searches have unearthed virtually no clues in any of their cases, but members of every family have banded together to help in the search efforts and cope with their shared grief. If you have any information regarding any of these five cases, please contact the San Francisco Police Department at (415) 558-5508.</p><p><strong>Christina Bastian</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>High school teacher Christina Bastian and her dog, Coco, were last seen together in the early hours of November 1, 2015, at a friend's home near Apple Valley, California. The 34-year-old’s belongings were later found strewn along Highway 247, near Lucerne Valley. Her truck was located, abandoned, on a dirt road along Highway 62. The next day, her dog Coco was found alive by a stranger nearly 70 miles from where the truck had been located. In the six years since Christina vanished, there have been few clues discovered in the case. Her mother, Cheryl Denny, continues to post on the Facebook page<a href=#> Help Find Christina Bastian</a> and tirelessly searches for her daughter. If you have any information regarding Christina’s case, please call the Apple Valley Police Department at (760) 240-7400.</p><p><strong>Nancy Bromet</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Nancy Bromet left her father’s home in Sunrise, Florida on November 12, 2015, to head to Bakersfield, California with her boyfriend, a long-haul truck driver. Several days later, the 37-year-old called her sister Laura saying she was in distress and wanted to come home. Soon after that phone call, Nancy was reported missing by her boyfriend, who reportedly told police he dropped her off at a shopping mall outside El Centro, California, while he was finishing deliveries. He said Nancy was not there when he returned, according to police. Few clues have been discovered in the case, and the investigation is still “open and active,” authorities said. If you have any information regarding Nancy’s case, please call the El Centro Police Department at (760) 337-4861.</p><p><strong>Cecilia Cabrera</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The last images of Cecilia Cabrera were captured on security footage from the Tachi Palace Casino in Lemoore, California. It was just before 1 a.m. on June 9, 2016, when the 31-year-old was seen leaving the casino in her dark grey Chevrolet Malibu. Several hours later, a call came in to the California State Highway Patrol that a burning vehicle had been discovered in an orchard near Goshen, about 30 miles away from the casino. It was Cecilia’s car, but she was not inside. Cecilia was last seen with her husband, Francisco Valdivia. In December of 2016, the Tulare County District Attorney's office filed charges against Valdivia for felony murder and arson. A woman, Rosalina Lopez, who was also married to Valdivia, was charged with one felony count of being an accessory to murder after the fact. Valdivia and Lopez were arraigned at the Tulare County Pretrial Facility on Dec. 14, 2016. There was no bail set for Valdivia and bail for Lopez was set at $500,000. to the Sun Gazette in June 2019, Cecilia’s son, Juan, has joined the Tulare County Sheriff’s Office Explorer Program and plans to pursue a career as a TCSO Deputy Sheriff. As of 2021, Cecilia’s body has still not been found. If you have any information in Cecilia’s case, please call the Tulare County Sheriff's Department at (559) 735-1880.</p><p><strong>Donald Cavanaugh</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Donald Cavanaugh was one of two men who went missing more than a decade ago after working on the same small horse ranch in California outside Westport, a town with only 60 residents. Donald, then 63, was reported missing in May 2005, in Ukiah, California after a dispute with his nephew, James DeNoyer, who was the ranch owner. David Neily, 69, was reported missing in Westport, California just one year later, also reportedly after a confrontation with DeNoyer. Both men's vehicles were found on DeNoyer's ranch property. DeNoyer denies having any information or involvement in either man’s disappearance and has not been named a suspect. For years, both have been feared dead. In May 2021, human remains were found by an employee at a private nature reserve in an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in Branscomb, about 3.5 miles from where David’s car had been found 15 years ago. DNA analysis of the remains and dental records examined by Jim Wood, a California Assembly member and forensic dentistry expert, determined they belonged to David. The examinations found no evidence of trauma and the sheriff’s office continues to investigate the circumstances surrounding Neily’s disappearance. Donald Cavanaugh is still missing. If you have information about either of these cases, you are encouraged to call the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office at (707) 234-2100.</p><p><strong>Dane Elkins</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>UC Santa Cruz student Dane Elkins, 21, was last known to be in the area of Castaic, California, around 8:20 p.m. on December 21, 2020. His car was found abandoned with a flat tire. His wallet and cell phone were located inside, but there was no sign of Dane. Dane’s mother, Deborah, told Dateline she spoke to her son that day. She added that in the days leading up to his disappearance, Dane had become mentally distressed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and that he had been driving back and forth between their home in Brentwood and Santa Cruz, where he is an engineering student. He holds 23 national championships as a racquetball player and holds a black belt in Taekwondo. He also spent hours of his free time helping his mother as a volunteer to feed the homeless population in the Los Angeles area. For the past year, Dane’s family has used social media to reach out to the community for information on his whereabouts. A Facebook group<a href=#> Searching for Dane Elkins</a> and the TikTok account<a href=#> @KindnessMom</a> were launched to help with the search. In recent months, there have been reported sightings of Dane that his mother believes are legitimate and gives her hope that he is still alive. She said that anyone who believes they have spotted someone who might be Dane is encouraged to take a photo of the individual and send it to <a href=#>searchingfordaneelkins@gmail.com</a>, which will allow the family to better determine if it actually could be Dane before passing it along to investigators. Dane is described as being 5’11” tall and weighing 170 lbs. He has brown hair and green eyes. His family said he had facial hair in the days before his disappearance. Anyone with information on his location is urged to call the LAPD’s Missing Persons Unit at (213) 996-1800. During non-business hours or on weekends, calls should be directed to 1-877-LAPD-24-7 (877-527-3247). Anyone wishing to remain anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at 800-222-TIPS (800-222-8477).</p><p><strong>Monique Figueroa</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Monique Figueroa told her family on May 19, 2015, that she was heading from her father’s home in Littlerock, California to visit friends in Los Angeles. Police recovered her 2004 Mercedes abandoned in a rural area outside Los Angeles several days later. Forensic tests were conducted, but no clues to Monique’s disappearance were uncovered. Several searches conducted over the past six years in relation to the case have not yielded anything significant. “I love my daughter; I would love her remains to be found and this case brought to a closure,” her father Jeff told Dateline. A $20,000 reward for information leading to arrests and conviction in Monique’s disappearance was reestablished by the<a href=#> Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors</a> on April 4, 2021. If you have any information regarding Monique’s case, please call the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department at (323) 890-5500 or Detective Karen Shonka at the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5621 and refer to Report No. 015-07325-2661-400.</p><p><strong>Diana Rose Alejandre Garcia Gonzalez</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Diana Rose Alejandre Garcia Gonzalez had been known to travel between Winterhaven, California, Yuma, Arizona, and Mexico, but when she hadn’t been in contact with her family since April 2020, she was reported missing in that June. The 31-year-old, who was last seen on May 4, 2020, had been living with her girlfriend, Danielle Meeden, in Winterhaven. Diana had left her purse, cell phone and personal belongings behind. Investigator J. Hurtado confirmed to Dateline in 2020 that the sheriff’s office is actively searching for Diana and that it is an ongoing missing persons case. He added that they have interviewed several people about Diana’s disappearance. “There are many stories and rumors around this case right now,” Investigator Hurtado said. “So it’s hard to say at this time if foul play is involved.” Diana is described as being 5'3" tall and weighing approximately 180 lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes. Diana’s family said she dyes her hair often, so it may be a lighter brown or blonde color. Anyone who may have information about Diane’s whereabouts is asked to contact the Imperial County Sheriff’s Office Investigation Unit at 442-265-2105 and reference case #2006-1642.</p><p><strong>Max Greenfield</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On the night of March 17, 2018, Max Greenfield began messaging his friends asking if anyone wanted to go to the Lucky 7 Casino in Smith River, California. The casino was less than a 15-minute drive from Max’s house in Bookings, Oregon, and family says he went there often with friends. Security footage provided by the casino shows Max, 25, arriving around 1 a.m. A Curry County Sheriff’s Office press release says Max was then seen going outside the casino and waiting near the back door. Around 1:50 a.m., security footage shows Max talking to a white adult male in front of the casino. Max and the man are then seen walking south across the parking lot, parallel to Highway 101, until they go off camera, still walking south. Eighteen minutes later, the man re-enters the casino alone. In a statement to authorities, the man said he and Max “went separate ways after leaving the casino.” After conducting numerous interviews and searches, police tell Dateline they have suspects in the case but are not publicly releasing their names. Authorities say foul play is suspected and Max’s case is being treated as a homicide investigation. If you have any information on Max’s case, please call Detective Jerrin Gill at (707) 465-2468.</p><p><strong>Karlie Gusé</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On October 12, 2018, 16-year-old Karlie Gusé left her home in Chalfant, California to hang out with friends nearby. Karlie’s stepmother, Melissa, told Dateline she picked Karlie up from town and brought her home around 9 p.m. According to Melissa, they ate dinner together before Karlie went to bed. Karlie’s father, Zachary, told Dateline that Karlie seemed “disoriented” before she went to bed, but would not comment further on her condition. Melissa said she went to Karlie’s room early the next morning to check on her stepdaughter, but Karlie was nowhere to be found. Five months later, Melissa appeared on the Dr. Phil daytime talk show, and told Dr. Phil she had lied to NBC in October when she spoke to Dateline. “Melissa, you told NBC, the next morning that at 5:45 a.m., you did your usual routine of opening up the kids’ doors, saying good morning, getting them ready for school -- that sort of thing. Did you -- she was still in bed at that time -- did you go back and lay down?” Dr. Phil asked Melissa on the show which aired on March 25, 2019. “No. That -- the Dateline NBC?” Melissa answered. “Yeah, that was a false story. Because I wasn’t – it was a lie about checking in on Karlie. Because it was in the beginning, and I didn’t know what to say and – I shouldn’t have even done the interview.” Karlie’s mother, Lindsay Fairley, who lives in Nevada, told Dateline in 2018 that she had been sick to her stomach from the pain her daughter’s disappearance had caused. Authorities say Karlie was last seen wearing a white t-shirt and grey sweatpants. There have been reported sightings of Karlie in the past few years, but none has turned out to be her. If you have any information surrounding Karlie’s disappearance, please call the Mono County Sheriff’s Office at 760-932-7549 and select option 7.</p><p><strong>Rico Omarr Harris</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Former Harlem Globetrotter Rico Omarr Harris was in the middle of a big life move from California to Oregon in the fall of 2014.

She was first reported missing October 20 when she failed to pick her son up from school, and the case was transferred to robbery-homicide investigators on October 29. Hours after she was last seen, her dog was found on the 28th floor of an apartment building in Downtown Los Angeles. Her ex-husband, Jim Wayne, told Dateline he doesn't know how the dog got into the building and doesn't believe Heidi knew anyone in the building. Police have said their investigation led them to the Chiquita Canyon Landfill, about 40 miles northwest of the downtown location where Heidi was last seen.</p><p>“Forensic evidence was located inside the building which has led detectives to believe an incident occurred resulting in Planck’s death,” police said. On November 29, Los Angeles police began searching the California landfill for evidence connected to her disappearance. Police said in a statement that they were looking in "a specific area" of the landfill for human remains. Police said there is still no lead on a suspect in what they believe is a robbery-homicide. The excavation operation is expected to take over a week and police warned of a potential “impact on community members who live around the Chiquita Canyon Landfill, specifically the community of Val Verde.” Police asked for tips from anyone who was at the residential building at 1201 S.

In July, Larry Millete was named a “person of interest” in the case. He denied any involvement in his wife’s disappearance. By October, he had been arrested and charged with her murder. At a press conference on October 20, authorities released new details, alleging that Larry used a black Lexus to transport Maya’s body on January 8, 2021. San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan revealed other new details, which included the fact that in 2020 Larry had been visiting “spellcasters” — people purporting to wield magical powers of persuasion — in an effort to make Maya want to stay in the relationship. Stephan added that Maya had scheduled an appointment with a divorce lawyer on January 12, but never made it. The last recorded activity on her phone was on January 8. Larry remains in the San Diego County Jail on no bond. Maya’s family continues to hold prayer vigils online and in person. At the press conference, her sister Maricris thanked the community and made a promise to Maya’s children: to find their mother’s body.

His family says he suffers from depression and bipolar disorder and is worried because it’s unlike him to not be in contact with someone. He does not have a cell phone or ID on him, but could have been traveling to Denver or Salt Lake City, where he has friends, or to his hometown in Minnesota.

She was supposed to attend her sister’s baby shower the next day, but never showed up. In July 2018, police identified 29-year-old Juan Jose Figueroa Jr. as a suspect in Rita’s disappearance as a result of testing from evidence submitted to forensic laboratories. On March 22, 2019, Figueroa was convicted of sexual assault, felony assault and attempted murder in an unrelated 2017 sexual assault case. He was sentenced to 93 years in prison. In June 2021, Figueroa was charged with Rita’s kidnapping and murder, according to court documents, and indicted by a grand jury. Documents show that Figueroa and Rita were together the night she disappeared and that a forensic search of Figueroa’s truck revealed DNA believed to belong to her. Figueroa confided to his cellmate that he had strangled Rita and disposed of her body after she had called him a “weirdo,” according to the documents. He also allegedly told the cellmate that he had buried Rita’s body and that the only way anyone would find it is if police inserted a probe into his brain. In October 2021, Figueroa appeared in Boulder District Court virtually from prison and pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial is set for early 2022. Rita’s body has never been found.

After nine years of searching and countless interviews, the El Paso Sheriff’s Office has been unable to find any significant leads.

Video released by the Pueblo Police Department shows Schelling’s black 2011 Chevrolet Cruze parked in front of a Walmart store around noon the following day. The vehicle had been left there overnight. The next day at 7:20 a.m., an unidentified person can be seen getting into Schelling’s car and driving away. The car was found abandoned a week later at Saint Mary Corwin Medical Center. In November of 2017, tips led police to conduct searches in several different areas of Pueblo in connection with Kelsie’s case, but authorities told Dateline they were unable to find anything of significance. On December 1, 2017, police arrested Donthe Lucas for the first-degree murder of Kelsie. In August of 2018, Lucas pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. The trial was scheduled to start in April 2019, but new evidence found in the case over the summer postponed it until January 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial was pushed back to September and again to January 25, 2021. In March 2021, after just a few hours of deliberations, a Pueblo County jury found Donthe Lucas guilty of first-degree murder. He was sentenced afterward to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Police told Dateline they have searched multiple locations over the years, but have not found Kelsie’s remains.

After not hearing from their daughter for several days, Charlene’s parents reported her missing on July 8, 2016.

The dog had been decapitated. In June 2020, an Arapahoe County grand jury in Colorado indicted Jeffery Scott Beier for Charlene’s murder. According to the affidavit, investigators believe Beier dumped the items at Tower Landfill in Commerce City, Colorado on July 2, 2016. He is charged with first-degree murder, first-degree felony murder, sexual assault, two counts of tampering with evidence, third-degree assault and two counts of attempting to influence a public servant, by misleading authorities about Charlene’s disappearance. He is also charged with aggravated animal cruelty. Shortly after Charlene vanished, Beier moved to Russia, where he was been in custody since 2020 pending a decision on extradition.

The 21-year-old Dawsonville, Georgia mother was last seen in Hollywood, Florida, on July 25, 2020, driving a white mid-to-late 90s Chevy Silverado 3500 pickup truck with a red tailgate and a “Baby on Board” sign on the passenger window. On July 28, Leila’s pickup truck was found abandoned in a Walmart parking lot in Hollywood, two miles from where her son had been found the day before. In August, federal agents arrested Shannon Demar Ryan in Florida and charged him with kidnapping in connection to Leila’s disappearance. Shortly before Ryan’s arrest, he posted a video online discussing how he met up with Leila at a RaceTrac gas station in Hollywood on July 25 to buy her truck before her disappearance. According to the arrest affidavit provided to Dateline, Ryan told investigators he paid $3,000 to Leila for her truck and the three of them left in his 2004 Gold Lexus ES 330 to spend the day at Fort Lauderdale beach, leaving the truck behind. When they returned, he said he parked at the gas pumps at RaceTrac and told investigators that Leila and her son left in a dark sedan with several unknown men. He stated it was the last time he saw her. According to the affidavit, law enforcement reviewed the security footage from the RaceTrac gas station, but it did not show Ryan’s car at the pumps where he described it, and it did not show Leila leaving in a dark sedan. Investigators say a car resembling Ryan’s was spotted on security video in front of the apartment complex in Miramar just minutes before Leila’s son was found. On August 15, law enforcement officials searched Ryan’s Lexus and discovered a half-empty container of all-purpose cleaner with bleach, several black trash bags and a white powdery substance. In October 2020, the FBI in Miami searched the Monarch Hill Landfill in Pompano Beach, but did not release further details in the investigation, or how they were able to zero in on the landfill. “The FBI continues to actively pursue every lead related to this investigation,” the department said in a statement. “We are still seeking information about Leila Cavett’s disappearance.” According to information released by the Hollywood Police Department in May 2021, Ryan is now facing charges of second-degree murder and tampering with evidence in connection to Leila’s disappearance. A charge of child neglect without great bodily harm was added. Shannon Ryan is being held at Broward County Jail without bond. Leila is described as having been 5’4” and weighing about 110 lbs, with brown, shoulder-length hair and brown eyes. She had a tattoo that reads “Kamdyn” on her right arm and a small tattoo of a Christian fish symbol on her right wrist.

Mo’s daughter, Alexis, reported her mother missing two days later, on November 14, 2014. Several days after that, Mo's belongings were found just a few miles from her Maui, Hawaii home in a dumpster behind the Wailuku Community Center. On September 20, 2019, Brown was indicted by a grand jury for Mo’s murder. He pleaded not guilty to second degree murder. According to the<a href=#> Associated Press</a> in October, a judge denied a defense request to move his trial away from Maui. Defense attorney Gerald Johnson cited the need “to prevent jury contamination,” given publicity generated during the search for Mo on Maui. The prosecution opposed moving the trial. Judge Peter Cahill decided there was no basis to move the trial at this point. Jury selection for his trial was expected to start in December 2021, but Brown recently fired his attorney. The judge has set a date of December 9 for an appearance of new counsel for Brown. He is being held on a $1 million bail at the Maui Community Correctional Center. Mo’s family and friends created a ‘<a href=#>Mowatch’ page</a> that is dedicated to finding their lost loved one and to helping other families of missing persons in Hawaii spread awareness.

The 18-year-old was reportedly walking in the 1000 block of South Washington Street just south of Kokomo, Indiana’s downtown area. She was reported missing two days later. Little is known about the events leading to Karena’s disappearance. Her grandmother, Gerry McClerkin, told Dateline in 2017 that somewhere along the line, Karena had gotten involved with a number of substance abuse issues, and had been hanging out with an older crowd. However, Karena had allegedly spoken about the possibility of going to a rehabilitation facility in Florida. Family says she had begun filling out the paperwork when she disappeared. On September 26, 2020, Karena’s 22nd birthday, the Kokomo Police Department reminded the public that her case remains an active investigation and they continue to seek assistance from the community. “In the past four years, KPD investigators have pursued numerous leads and tips, but the case remains open. This investigation is ongoing, as we still continue to search for Karena McClerkin. KPD investigators believe this investigation can be resolved and ask that if you know something, say something,” the release from the Kokomo Police Department stated.

Independence Police Chief Jerry Harrison told Dateline last year that there were various reports from friends of Detreck, who said they saw him in mid-April in the Independence area. Police believe the last confirmed sighting was on April 12, 2020 in Independence. Chief Harrison would not share any further details on the case and told Dateline it is still an open investigation, but investigators do believe Detreck was murdered. In September 2020, the Kansas Governor signed a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for Detreck’s disappearance and suspected murder. He is described as being 5’9” tall, weighing 190 lbs, with black hair and brown eyes.

The night she was last seen, Brookelyn went with her younger sister, a cousin and some friends to a party outside Berea, Kentucky. Although her family members decided to leave, Brookelyn chose to stay behind. The details surrounding the rest of the night remain a mystery, but it was around 4 a.m. the next day when Brookelyn sent text messages to friends saying she needed a ride home because she was “scared.” Police arrived at the party house several hours later.

Two days later, her unlocked Chevy Impala was found along Kentucky's Bluegrass Parkway with a flat tire and her belongings still inside. The Nelson County Sheriff officially named Crystal’s boyfriend a suspect in her disappearance in October of 2015. Houck's brother, who worked as a Bardstown police officer, was terminated from the department after officials say he interfered with the investigation into Crystal's disappearance. Danny L. Singleton, a longtime employee of Houck, was charged with 38 counts of perjury for lying to investigators under oath in December of 2015. Houck was arrested in July of 2018 on four felony theft counts and four misdemeanor theft counts, unrelated to Crystal’s disappearance. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. On April 25, 2019, a jury found Houck not guilty on charges that he stole roofing shingles from a Nelson County Lowe's store. No charges have been filed in connection with Crystal’s disappearance, but officials have said they believe Crystal is dead. In August 2020, the FBI took over as the lead agency in the investigation. More than 150 state and federal law enforcement officers arrived in Bardstown and executed new search warrants at several properties connected to Brooks Houck. In the summer of 2021, FBI agents began excavation efforts at a home in the subdivision built by Houck in Bardstown. In September 2021, the<a href=#> FBI announced in a tweet</a> that it concluded its latest search efforts. According to the statement, several “items of interest” were sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, but the FBI has remained silent on the details of their findings. The FBI urged those who may have information about the case to come forward. The FBI's Crystal Rogers Task force website was created so people can share information regarding the case. There is a $25,000 reward for information that leads to her whereabouts.

Dusty told police that he and Samantha had spent the previous night sleeping on a four-wheeler in the woods. In the morning, he said Samantha took off in one direction and he went in the other. Samantha hasn’t been seen since. The Graves County Sheriff’s Department told Dateline in 2018 that through search warrants, they collected and sent more than 30 pieces of evidence for examination in connection with Samantha’s disappearance. Investigators have conducted laboratory analysis of evidence that was submitted and a detailed review of electronic evidence, but said in an effort to not compromise the integrity of the ongoing investigation, more specific details cannot be released at this time.</p><p>Authorities said they worked with the Kentucky State Police to try to triangulate cell phones to get a clear picture of people’s whereabouts at various time frames surrounding Samantha’s disappearance, but it has not led to her location. Police also say they have questioned both Samantha’s boyfriend, Rhen Hendrickson, and his father, Dusty, multiple times and both have passed polygraph tests. In 2020, the FBI and other outside agencies joined the investigation to help with interviewing and re-interviewing witnesses or persons of interest, conduct a detailed and methodical review of all electronic evidence, and laboratory analysis of evidence submitted. There have been no arrests or persons of interest named in connection to Samantha’s disappearance. Despite many searches by local, state and federal officials, investigators have little evidence to lead to her whereabouts, but authorities say the case is still open and active.

A witness told police he saw the 25-year-old mother being forced into a silver Chrysler minivan. Investigators found Jessica's cell phone, keys and purse inside the store. In September 2016, officials charged Jeffrey Willis, 46, with abduction and murder in relation to Jessica’s case. He pleaded not guilty. At the time he was facing charges for the April 2016 abduction of a teenager who ended up escaping. She led police to a van where, according to court testimony, investigators found bondage items and lists of women’s names and addresses. According to NBC affiliate WOOD-TV, investigators said they found a file labeled “VICS” (short for victims) that contained a folder labeled with the initials of a jogger named Rebekah Bletsch who had been found shot to death in 2014. The folder also contained a code for her date of death. In November 2017, Willis was convicted of first-degree premeditated murder and felony firearm in connection to Rebekah’s 2014 shooting death. Police told WOOD-TV there was also a file bearing Jessica’s initials on Willis’s computer. On May 16, 2018, Willis was found guilty of Jessica’s kidnapping and murder. Willis is serving two life sentences: one for killing Jessica in 2013 and the other for killing Rebekah Bletsch. On December 3, 2019, Willis asked the Michigan Court of Appeals to grant him a new trial in Jessica’s murder, stating that some of the evidence that the jury saw in his trial should not have been admitted, according to WOOD-TV. The court agreed some evidence should have been excluded at trial, but said that didn’t outweigh other “strong untainted evidence” that showed Willis was responsible for Jessica’s death. On December 27, 2019, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that Willis’s arguments had no merit and that his conviction for Jessica’s kidnapping and murder will stand. Jessica’s body has not been found. Police told Dateline they continue to search but have no leads as to Jessica’s location. If you have any information regarding Jessica’s case, please call the Norton Shores Police Department at (231) 733-2691 or the Silent Observer at (231) 722-7463.</p><p><strong>Alasia Hill</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Alasia Hill, 23, was last seen by her mother on March 10, 2021, at a doctor’s appointment in the 2700 block of East Grand Boulevard in Detroit, Michigan. Charisma Carucci told Dateline that her daughter had spent most of February in the hospital due to an infection that led to a medically-induced coma. While in the coma, Alasia suffered complications and the decision was made to amputate her hand. After the appointment to remove the stitches, Alasia went home with her boyfriend, and called her mother that evening to let her know how she was doing. But when there was no call the next day, Charisma called Alasia’s boyfriend, Marlon Billingslea. She explained that since Alasia didn’t have her own phone, she used his. When Charisma spoke to Marlon, she says he told her Alasia had left and that he didn’t know where she had gone. Marlon told Dateline it was the morning of March 11 when Alasia walked out of the house without any explanation of where she was going, despite him asking. He said he followed her, but eventually let her be and returned home. Alasia is described by family as bright and kind, someone who showed a lot of promise just a few years ago when she graduated a year early from high school and enrolled in a nursing program at a local college.

Mackson of the Detroit Police Department told Dateline in May that they continue to follow up on any leads or tips that come in, but nothing has led them to Alasia. She stressed that at that point, they had no reason to believe foul play is involved, but encouraged anyone with information to call the police.

Galloway is a former security guard at the MetLife building where Danielle worked at the time of her disappearance. Authorities searched Galloway’s residence three weeks after Danielle vanished. Floorboards, several pieces of carpet, a mattress and Galloway’s car were removed from his home and sent for testing, according to police. The judge ruled there was enough evidence to proceed to trial after Oakland County Medical Examiner Dr. Ljubisa J. Dragovic testified that he came to the conclusion Danielle died of asphyxiation, even though her body has not been found. The trial was initially scheduled for early 2020, but got pushed back multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020, Circuit Court Judge Phyllis McMillen met with attorneys over Zoom and determined there will be a January 14, 2021 hearing. The trial has now been scheduled for March 2022. Galloway is currently in prison for choking and attempting to rape a jogger in Hines Park. Anyone with information regarding the case, or who may have seen Danielle or her Jeep on December 2, 2016, is urged to call the Farmington Hills Police Department at (248) 871-2610.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Shannah Boiteau</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Shannah Boiteau was last seen on June 22, 2016 near St. Cloud, Minnesota.

She was barefoot and without her purse when she vanished into the thick woods parallel to the highway. Authorities reportedly witnessed her looking distressed as she made her way into the trees. What happened next is unknown. Both the St. Cloud and Chippewa Falls Police Departments have conducted several searches to find Shannah, but have been unsuccessful.

Aneisah told Dateline she visited Wendy at her home in Mankato, Minnesota, the night before, on May 31, 2018. Aneisah said she left after Wendy’s boyfriend, Mohammed Bilal Chughtai, came home that night. A few days later, on Sunday, June 3, when Aneisah had not heard from her mother, she went to check on her. No one answered the door, so she went to the Mankato Police Department and filed a missing person’s report. On June 7, six days after Aneisah last spoke to her mother, authorities located Wendy’s vehicle on Belle Avenue, behind a Mankato CVS. According to Mankato Public Safety Commander Jeremy Clifton the car had a flat tire. Wendy vanished with just her purse and her cell phone. Police have yet to locate either of those items. Aneisah told Dateline in 2019 that her mother’s bank account was last accessed on May 30, 2018, and her phone has not been used since June 2, 2018. Investigators searched Wendy’s boyfriend’s car and the home but found no evidence of foul play. Dateline was unable to reach Chughtai in 2019 for his recollection of events of the days surrounding Wendy’s disappearance. The Mankato Department of Public Safety has not named any persons of interest or suspects in Wendy’s case. “It’s an open and active missing persons investigation,” Commander Clifton told Dateline. Wendy Khan is described as being 5’5” tall and weighing 160 lbs, with red hair and green eyes.

Several days after the 26-year-old was last seen, her vehicle was found abandoned in a rural area not far from her last known whereabouts. Inside were a number of her valuable personal items, including her laptop. Her cell phone was found in a nearby field. There appeared to be a break in the case when police questioned John Bentley Poisso Jr., 57, following his arrest on unrelated misdemeanor charges. After searches of his home, no evidence was found linking him to the disappearance. However, authorities do consider him a person of interest, as he was the last person known to have seen Rebecca before she vanished. Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Department Chief Deputy Ward Calhoun said that investigators are still working the case. In 2020, Rebecca’s family increased the reward to $20,000 for information leading to her whereabouts.

Her boyfriend, Jerry Wayne Baggett, told law enforcement officials that he and Jessica had launched the boat into the river near the County Road 46 bridge in the early morning hours of New Year’s Day. They were on the water for a couple of hours when Jessica reportedly got out of the boat and made her way toward the north river bank in the direction of State Highway 30. Her purse and car keys were left behind, and her cell phone was later turned in by an individual who stated that he had it because Jessica and Baggett had planned to call him on it to be picked up at the end of their boating trip that day. Jessica was reported missing by her boyfriend at 10:15 p.m. that evening. Due to flooding, drones with thermal imaging cameras searched the river bottom between the Tallahatchie and Highway 30. A Mississippi Highway Patrol helicopter searched the river and river bottom downstream from County Road 46. When the flood waters receded, divers searched the river but found nothing. On January 2, investigators found a single green rubber boot with the top cut off. Baggett had told authorities previously that Jessica had cut the top off of her boot because it was rubbing on her leg. A coat believed to be Jessica’s was also found near the boot. Authorities have spent hours talking to Jessica’s boyfriend, but it has not led them to her. Sheriff Jimmy Edwards with the Union County Sheriff’s Office maintains that they “do not have any evidence that points to foul play at this time.” Jessica’s case is considered an “active” one, but he says no new evidence has developed. He added that they are following every lead and encourage anyone with information to call the sheriff’s office. Jessica is described as being 5’4” tall, weighs 110-125 lbs, with blonde hair and green eyes. She has multiple tattoos, including a puzzle piece with the names Cobie and Brayden.

Patrick, 34, arrived at a family friend’s house around 10 p.m. on the evening of May 10. By the next morning, Patrick, and the 1995 burgundy Escort Station Wagon he had been driving, were both gone. On June 5, his 1995 Burgundy Escort Station Wagon was found about two miles away on a 4-wheeler path in Wayne County. The car had bumper damage and flat tires. Patrick’s wallet, containing his ID and bank card, was found inside the car, but his cell phone and car keys have not been located. His ex-wife, Jen, told Dateline that Patrick, who worked as a tow-truck driver, was known to couch surf or go camping, so it was believed he had just moved on to a different location. But when no one had heard from him over the next couple of weeks, a family friend reported him missing to the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office on May 30. Missouri State Highway Patrol Cpl. J.T. Wilson, who has been assisting the sheriff’s office since mid-June 2020, says the case remains a missing persons case and there have been no recent updates.

Master Sergeant Danielle Heil with the Missouri State Highway Patrol told Dateline in 2020 that David’s disappearance is still an active investigation and they are following all tips and leads that they receive.

The next day, May 10, she drove to her house in Edwards, Missouri to deliver a Mother’s Day card and flowers. But her mother didn’t appear to be home. So she left the card and flowers on the porch, with a note asking her to call. But she never did. On Monday, Kelsey tried calling her mother on both her cell and house phones. Kelsey said she continued calling every morning of every day that week, but the calls went straight to voicemail. On Friday, May 15, Kelsey drove back over to her mother’s house. But this time, her mother’s locked car was in the driveway. So she broke into the house and found her mother’s purse with her wallet, ID and cash, inside the house, but her cell phone, keys and pistol were missing. Echo hasn’t used her cell phone or filled prescriptions since her disappearance. The Benton County Sheriff’s Office and the Missouri State Highway Patrol said they have been actively investigating every lead and tip. There have been no recent developments in Echo’s case, but authorities released information that she was sighted at 30617 Stag Drive, Edwards, Missouri, on May 14, 2020.

She had been spending the day at the pool with her younger brother, but when their mother came to pick them up, Ashley was gone. Her brother and other witnesses said she had gotten into a car with a man later identified as Christopher Hart. Ashley’s friends and witnesses from the pool were questioned and told police that Ashley had talked about running away. In the months following Ashley’s disappearance, Hart was arrested multiple times on unrelated charges. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Missouri for assault and tampering with a motor vehicle. The current investigator on the case, Sgt. Jason Strong, told Dateline that Hart is a person of interest in Ashley's disappearance. He added that authorities have followed up on all recent tips in the case and used Ashley’s DNA to compare with unidentified bodies found in the area, but nothing has led to Ashley. At the time of her disappearance, Ashley was 5’3” tall and weighed about 110 lbs. She has sandy blonde hair and blue eyes, and has a scar on her left wrist. Her tongue, naval and ears are pierced. In July 2014, Ashley’s family and the St. Joseph Parks, Recreation & Civic Faculties Department, planted a sugar maple tree at Krug pool. Tammy told Dateline that the specific tree was chosen because in the fall its leaves turn red - Ashley’s favorite color. The idea of the tree was Ashley’s grandmother’s. In early 2021, Ashley’s grandmother died and the family has since planted another tree, this time in her honor, right next to Ashley’s tree.

Detective Dan Torgrimson of the Albuquerque Police Department told Dateline that authorities suspect foul play in Liz’s disappearance, but no one has been arrested. The detective noted that Martinez’s phone movements corroborate his story, but added that as the last person known to have seen Liz, he is considered a person of interest. However, “without evidence or a body, it’s hard for the investigation to move forward.” At the time of her disappearance, Liz was four months pregnant, 5’7, 130 lbs, with brown hair and green eyes.

Farmington Police Department Public Information Officer Nicole Brown told Dateline Calvin’s case is still an open investigation and they will continue to collect information and follow all leads. Calvin is 5’6” tall, 200 lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes. He has several tattoos, including one on his right arm that reads “Martinez Family.” Anyone with information on Calvin’s whereabouts is asked to call Detective Chavez at 505-566-2370, the FPD tip line 505-599-1068, or San Juan County Crime Stoppers 505-334-8477.</p><p><strong>Wade Taylor</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Marine Corps combat veteran Wade Taylor was last seen in the very early morning hours of May 6, 2017, by jail personnel at the Otero County Detention Center in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Authorities confirmed to Dateline that Wade was not being held in the jail at the time, but had come of his own accord for unknown reasons. Wade, then 38, had been honorably discharged after serving four years in the Marines, including in Afghanistan. Authorities tell Dateline that evidence has been sent to crime labs for analysis, but they would not provide details to protect the integrity of the investigation. Police say foul play is suspected and there are people of interest in the case, but their names have not been released to the public. Anyone who may have seen Wade that early morning, or have information regarding Wade’s whereabouts, is asked to call the Alamogordo Police Department at (575) 439-4300.</p><p><strong>Holly Alcott White</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In the spring of 2016, Holly Alcott White was preparing to relocate from Taos, New Mexico to Albuquerque to join her husband, who had just started a new job there. But Holly never got the chance to start the new chapter of her life. On May 5, 2016, just three months shy of her 50th birthday, Holly disappeared. Holly’s husband Jeff told Dateline that he spoke to his wife on the phone that night and nothing seemed amiss. The following morning, she was supposed to meet a friend for their daily walk, but never showed up. Holly’s purse and cell phone were found inside the home and later that day, her blue Ford Escape was found parked at the Río Grande Gorge Bridge. New Mexico State Police launched a search and with the help of a dive team and river raft guides, authorities searched 12 miles of the Río Grande Gorge. There was no sign of Holly’s body, but a single black Sketchers shoe was found floating in the river. The Río Grande Gorge Bridge has one of the highest bridge suicide rates per capita in the country, according to previous news coverage. But Holly’s family, friends, and her husband Jeff, have maintained through the years she would not have taken her own life, and she certainly wouldn’t have done so without leaving a note. Jeff told Dateline he was questioned in his wife’s disappearance and even took a polygraph test, which he said he passed. Police would not say if there are any suspects in Holly's disappearance at this time, but they urge anyone with information to come forward. At the time of her disappearance, she was described as being 5’11” tall and weighed about 275 lbs, with green eyes and blonde hair. Anyone with information about Holly’s case is asked to call the New Mexico State Police at 505-454-5010 or call the tip line at 575-613-3415. A $20,000 reward is being offered by Holly's father, Ray Alcott, for information that leads to Holly’s whereabouts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Norine Brown</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Norine Brown left her New Hyde Park, Long Island home around 11 p.m. on December 13, 1990, to go to the store to buy supplies to make cookies.

She was supposed to pick her daughter up from her mother’s house the next day, but she never arrived. Police would later learn Audrey, then 31, had never made it home from work. Neither Audrey nor her car, a 1994 black Jeep Grand Cherokee, has been seen since.

But they ended up at Knight’s father’s house in Michigan. Nieko's phone pinged for the last time at 5:05 p.m. on October 1, from Flintlock Drive in Franklin, Tennessee. He was never seen again. Knight died of a possible overdose in Michigan about 10 days after Nieko disappeared. For years, Nieko’s mother, Monica Button, continued to conduct her own investigation into his disappearance, but his case seemingly went cold until the summer of 2016 when New York State Police investigators and Franklin Police Department detectives got a break in the case. The dismantled and stripped down 2004 GMC pickup truck Nieko had been traveling in had been found stored in a residential detached garage in Nashville. In October 2017, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations (TBI) took over as the lead agency and in 2020 released a video stating they believe there are people who know how the truck got to the garage and know what possibly happened to Nieko. A $30,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to Nieko’s whereabouts. Nieko is described as 5’10”, weighing about 165 lbs, with a muscular build. He has brown hair and brown eyes and has an unfinished tattoo of a guardian angel on his left side, and four Chinese symbols on the back of his upper right arm.

The 25-year-old’s mother, who was visiting from Wyoming, told Dateline she last saw her daughter on Monday, September 17. They made plans to get together that Saturday. But on September 19, Kassandra left the home where she was staying at around 11:40 p.m., according to a press release from the New York Police Department. Her cousin later reported that Kassandra said she was going to meet up with an ex-boyfriend that night and if it got too late, she would be back in the morning. She never returned. Security video shows Kassandra going downstairs, helping an elderly woman with groceries, and turning left at Melrose Avenue and East 161st Street. She was reported missing to the NYPD on September 22. The New York Police Department confirmed to Dateline in December 2020 that they have spoken with the man Kassandra told her cousin she was going to go see, but would not comment further. They also declined to comment on whether foul play is suspected in Kassandra’s disappearance. As of November 2021, there have been no new updates.

Two months earlier, in July, just as the 19-year-old was set to finish high school, she contacted her mother and said she had met somebody who could give her a place to stay in New York City. Corinna left for New York with just her cell phone, ID, and the clothes on her back. Her family feared she had been entered into a sex-trafficking ring against her will. In November of 2018, authorities announced the arrest of Ishi Woney, 23, for sex trafficking and other offenses involving the sexual exploitation of young women, including Corinna. A press release at the time stated “Woney compelled his victim to engage in prostitution through force and coercion, and he used both this victim and Corinna Slusser, who has been missing since September 2017, in online advertisements promoting prostitution.” On November 26, 2019, Woney was sentenced to federal prison on sex trafficking charges, according to a spokesperson with the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney’s Office. He confirmed that Corinna’s disappearance was mentioned publicly at the court proceedings. The NYPD says they do not know Corinna’s whereabouts, and the investigation is ongoing. At the time of her disappearance, Corinna was 5’7”, 140 lbs, with blonde hair and a flower tattoo in the middle of her chest.

She left on foot to go see a friend, but never returned home. Officials have said they were able to use Tyarra’s cell phone GPS tracker to confirm she made it to her friend’s apartment, and appeared to be headed back home when she disappeared. In November 2020, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children <a href=#>released a video of Tyarra’s photos</a> with the hope that it might draw attention to the four-year-old case. Family members insist Tyarra would never have run away, and say she was planning to start classes soon on early childhood development at Guilford Technical Community College nearby.

A Union County Sheriff’s Office press release says witnesses saw her “leaving the plant in her white Honda of America uniform.” Patti, 29, had planned on going to Canada with her boyfriend for a week-long vacation. But when she failed to pick her daughter up from her sister’s house after the vacation, her family grew concerned. When family and police spoke to the boyfriend to ask where Patti was, he denied having any relationship at all with the missing young mother. Authorities say courts have since declared Patti legally dead. While no arrests have been made in connection to Patti’s disappearance and presumed death, her then-boyfriend is considered the primary suspect in the case. In August 2021, it was announced that a $25,000 reward was being offered by Concerned Citizens for Patti for information leading to her location.

A close friend, who lives in Columbus, came by the hotel to hang out with them. A few hours later, around 8:30 p.m., the three left the hotel to walk around the shopping center. They were out until about 3 a.m. and took an Uber back to the hotel. Brittany told Dateline that’s when the evening changed. Tyler seemed frustrated and decided to take a walk. Around 4:10 a.m., about one hour after Tyler left for the walk, he called and said he was in a wooded area but that he saw the hotel and he would be back in a few minutes. Brittany said he sounded confused. He called again and then hung up. When she tried to call him back, his phone was off. Tyler didn’t return the next morning, so Brittany called police and filed a missing persons report. Detectives from the Columbus Police Department have conducted multiple searches of the area. Tyler Davis was 29 at the time of his disappearance, and is described as being 5’10”, weighing 170 lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes.

Her mother discovered Parris’s cell phone left behind and hooked up to a charger in her vehicle, which was parked at the grandparents’ house. Her debit card and driver’s license were also inside the car. Massillon Police Department Detective Jason Gohlike told NBC affiliate WLWT they are continuing to investigate Parris’s disappearance, but have not received many tips or leads recently.

Megan, 25, had disappeared. Family members said the young mother of one son had fallen into a life of addiction before she vanished. Many have said Lancaster's case is eerily similar to the cases of several other missing women in surrounding counties over the past several years. In October 2020, Portsmouth city council member and attorney Michael Mearan was arrested on a total of 18 charges including human trafficking, racketeering and compelling and promoting prostitution. According to the<a href=#> Finding Megan Lancaster Facebook page</a>, Megan’s family believes Mearan is involved in her disappearance. In May 2021, police turned Mearan’s case over to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI). A trial date had been set for January 18, 2022. But on Friday, Nov. 26, Mearan died from “health complications,” according to his attorney, Michael Siewert of Siewert & Gjostein Co. LPA in Columbus. On December 3, 2021, Scioto County Prosecutor Shane A. Tieman released a statement in response to Mearan’s death, saying, in part, ”Justice takes place when all the parties in a case have their day in court so that their voices can be heard in a fair trial and a jury can render a just verdict.” However, he added, “With Mr. Mearan’s passing, this will not occur for any and all parties involved in this matter. It is very important to note that this investigation arose from local law enforcement officers, who took the time to listen to the concerns of some of our most ill-used citizens and the courage of those citizens to speak out.” If you have any information about Megan's disappearance, please contact the Portsmouth Police Department at (740) 353-4101.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Aubrey Dameron</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Aubrey Dameron, a 25-year-old citizen of the Cherokee Nation, was last seen leaving the home where she lived with her family on the outskirts of Grove, Oklahoma, in the early morning hours of March 9, 2019. Aubrey’s mother reported to police that she woke up around 3:30 a.m. and saw Aubrey leaving the house. She was reported missing when she failed to answer calls or return home. Her purse and medication had been left behind. Aubrey’s family fears that as a transgender Native American woman she may have been the victim of a hate crime. The family has found national support from Indigenous groups who have joined them in stepping up to raise awareness of Aubrey’s case. They’ve conducted several searches, many times with the help of the MMIWUSA. On March 23, 2019, a team searched near the family home and found a bloody sock about a half mile away, which was submitted to the Oklahoma State Bureau Investigation, but the family said they never received conclusive results. Aubrey is described as being 5’10” and weighing about 150 lbs. She has two tattoos: a triquetra symbol on her back and the word “Shorty” on her upper left arm.

Her sister, Justice Lindsey, told Dateline she received texts from Faith’s boyfriend stating that he couldn’t find her. A short time later, she received text messages from Faith’s phone she said were misspelled and did not make any sense. Faith was reported missing by family members on November 4, 2019. In December 2019, the Del City Police arrested 24-year-old Tanner Washington on a first-degree murder charge in connection with Faith’s disappearance. According to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI), the state charges were dismissed due to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in McGirt v. Oklahoma which says that Oklahoma authorities cannot arrest or prosecute anyone involved in a crime on reservation land, and tribal authorities cannot arrest or prosecute crimes committed by non-tribal members. However, a federal indictment for murder was returned for Washington after the federal grand jury in Muskogee completed its May 2021 session. The investigation is still open and ongoing as the OSBI works to locate Faith’s body. The OSBI is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to her location. Faith was 5’2”, 120 lbs, with brown hair and blue eyes. She had a tattoo on her abdomen of a key with the initials JL and SM, and a cross tattoo on her thumb.

She was reported missing after she did not pick up her 6-year-old son from the babysitter’s house in Old East Dallas that evening. Lieutenant Stephen Biggs with the Mesquite Police Department said they've interviewed hundreds of people in the case, but are still at a loss as to what happened to Prisma. The 26-year-old left her job at a car dealership for lunch on April 17 and never returned. She was spotted having lunch with her ex-boyfriend at the E Bar Tex Mex restaurant located on North Haskell Avenue. The man left, but police said Prisma stayed at the restaurant and continued drinking until police said she was asked to leave. Security video later showed her running into the garage of the Olympus at Ross apartments along Ross Avenue where her ex-boyfriend lived, but police learned he was not there at the time. Police told Dateline in 2019 that there was nothing that indicated foul play at the time, but were concerned that no one had heard from Prisma in months. Now, in 2021, police say there have been no updates and they encourage anyone with information to come forward. Prisma is described as 5’2” and weighs around 135 lbs. She has brown hair and brown eyes. Anyone with information about Prisma’s whereabouts is urged to call the Mesquite Police Department at (972) 285-6336.</p><p><strong>Chris Sanders</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On August 12, 2017, Chris Sanders was at a cookout with his friends at the Monahans County, Texas trailer park where he lived. His wife, who spoke with him on the phone that night, said he sounded tired and stressed out. The next morning, Chris went on a walk around 9:30 a.m. and never returned home.

The call ended abruptly, but officers were able to quickly pinpoint her approximate location and track down her vehicle. It was stuck in the mud on the side of a road in the Rock Hill community outside Panola County. A friend told Dateline they had been with Lauren in the area fishing when Lauren ran off suddenly down the road. Authorities said her bank accounts and phone records have remained untouched. Lauren’s three children are living with family. She is described as being approximately 5’5” tall and weighing 135 lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes.

Police say foul play is suspected in Samantha’s disappearance and a detective is actively working on her case. In January 2021, it was announced that Samantha’s case would be reclassified as a homicide as a result of new evidence. “Due to new information and advances in investigative and forensic technology, Samantha’s missing person investigation has been reclassified as an active abduction and murder investigation,” OPD Chief James Fenwick said. There have not been any updates since, but police are hoping someone will come forward.

Ben, 27, at the time, told the friend he was going home for the night because he was tired. He never made it home. The next day, according to the Virginia State Police, authorities found Ben’s 1998 Dodge van in Tappahannock, Virginia, about one hour away from where Ben was last seen. There were numerous personal items belonging to Ben still inside the van, including his dog, Clue. The dog was taken to a nearby animal shelter before being returned to Ben’s family. Each year around the anniversary of Ben’s disappearance, his family posts on the<a href=#> Help Us Find Ben Coffey Facebook page</a> about the pain they still feel. Ben is described as being 5’6” tall and weighs approximately 150 lbs. He has short brown hair, hazel eyes, and the symbol for the band “COHEED CAMBRIA” tattooed on his right arm.

The 44-year-old allegedly left her home around 11 p.m. that night after telling her husband she was going to walk to a friend’s house. Joan’s sister told Dateline it was completely out-of-character for Joan to leave the house on foot late at night. She was never seen again. Family believes foul play is involved and say Joan would never have left her young daughter behind. Joan is described as being 5’6” tall and weighing 120 lbs.

Renee never returned. Two days after she disappeared, police found her car abandoned about 20 miles from her house. Police say nothing was out of the ordinary with the car. Bloodhounds and cadaver dogs have searched both Renee’s home and the area near where her car was located, but nothing of significance has been found. Friends and family say Renee, 49 at the time, was a very private person who didn’t have any social media accounts, placing her even further off the grid and therefore harder for investigators to track. Authorities have investigated every lead they’ve received over the past seven years to try to locate Renee. If you have any information on details surrounding Renee’s disappearance, please call the Fluvanna County Sheriff's Office at (434) 589-8211.</p><p><strong>Claudine Jaquier Gifford</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Claudine Jaquier Gifford was last seen late on the night of July 6, 2014, at Pelican's at the Point, a beachfront tiki bar in White Stone, Virginia. According to the bar manager, the 43-year-old consumed a “couple of drinks,” and watched a band play. She was last seen by a witness, who said she was being helped out of the bar by her male acquaintance, James Todd Kessler. Kessler was the last person to see Claudine before she disappeared. After police investigated Kessler's home, traces of Claudine's blood were found, and he was charged in connection with her death. In August of 2015, a jury found Kessler guilty of second-degree murder and concealment of a body. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison for Claudine's murder. In December 2016, the Virginia Court of Appeals rejected his appeal. Claudine's body has still not been found. While the police consider the case closed, they are willing to assist in the search for Claudine’s body if further leads become available.

Keeshae said she’d be home the following day. She never came home. Her friends would later tell authorities they dropped Keeshae off that night in the Church Hill neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia, about 10 minutes away from her house. Keeshae said she was going to meet someone, the friends told Toni, but they didn’t know who the person was. Despite searches, police have not found Keeshae’s cell phone, ID, or the small bag of clothes she had with her for her overnight stay. Authorities suspect foul play in Keeshae’s disappearance and told Dateline they feel someone in the community knows something about what happened the night she vanished.

According to police, the 19-year-old and a man named Erik McFadden were planning to meet that evening, but McFadden later told authorities “the meeting never took place.” Police said that a detective made brief contact with McFadden immediately after Sage’s disappearance, “but [he] failed to show up to a scheduled interview with police and reportedly left town.” The Charlottesville Police Department continues to ask for the public’s help in locating Erik McFadden, whom police have identified as a “critical person of interest” in what they believe is the homicide of Sage Smith. In November of 2012, Sage, whose given name was Dashad, came out as transgender and changed her gender to “female” on Facebook. Local and federal agencies have spent “countless months and hours” scouring through evidence, interviews and witness statements. Despite their efforts, Public Information Officer Tyler Hawn told Dateline in November 2020 that the case remains unsolved. A year later, Charlottesville Police Sgt. Tony Newberry stressed to Dateline that even though there have been no recent updates, it remains an active investigation and that the department has “dedicated resources to the case so it can be worked full-time.” Sage Smith is described as being 5’11” and weighing about 130 lbs. Sage was last seen wearing a black jacket, dark gray sweatpants, a black scarf and gray boots. There is a $20,000 reward being offered for information that may lead to finding Sage’s remains or an arrest in the case.

On August 1, 2018, the 28-year-old decided to go on a hike by herself, as she often did. She planned to summit Vesper Peak in Washington’s North Cascades, a route she’d taken before, and told family she’d be gone from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Witnesses would later tell police they saw Samantha at the summit around 3 p.m. that day. But she never returned to her car at the base of the mountain. Since then, dozens of search and rescue teams have scoured the surrounding mountain ranges in the hope of finding Samantha, who is bald due to having alopecia. Neither she nor any of her belongings have been found. Authorities tell Dateline no evidence has been found in Samantha’s disappearance and while her case is an active missing persons case, they do not have any reason to believe her disappearance is suspicious in any way.

In 2018, a woman came forward saying she thought she saw two men in the back seat with a man matching Logan’s description. The Thurston County Sheriff’s Office has received many tips regarding potential sightings, as well as where remains may be located, but there have been no concrete leads into his disappearance.

She was seen again with the same man at 7:30 p.m. at the Chevron gas station next to the Swinomish Lodge & Casino. No one has seen her since. Her sister-in-law, Emily Pepper, told Dateline that the man stated that he had picked her up and they went to a nearby campground where he had been staying. He reportedly then dropped Laynee off between 2 and 3 a.m. at Causland Memorial Park, which is about two blocks from her motel. On September 13, Laynee’s mother, Barb, got a call from the motel. They were trying to reach Laynee because she hadn’t paid rent and no one had seen or heard from her in several days. She hasn’t used her cell phone and there has been no activity on her bank account. Her beloved dog, a rat terrier named Precious, who also went missing at the same time, has also not been found. For more than a year now, family and friends have gathered at Causland Park on the 10th of every month to keep Laynee’s case alive, hoping someone comes forward with information.
