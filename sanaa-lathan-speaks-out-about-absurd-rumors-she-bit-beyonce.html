They used to devastate me in my 20s, but in order to survive in this business, you just have to let it roll.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sanaa-lathan-and-beyonce.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Affair</a> star insisted that she would never have the audacity to do such a thing to Queen Bey, 36, because she is just one of the “Formation” singer’s many fans.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I adore Beyoncé,” she added. “I would never do anything malicious like that — to her, or to anyone. It’s so bizarre. I thought it was the funniest thing ever that it was a news story. It’s so crazy.”</p><p>As previously reported, <a href=#><strong>Tiffany Haddish</strong></a> first <a href=#>revealed in an interview with GQ</a> in March that an unnamed actress bit Beyoncé. “Near the end of the party, Beyoncé’s at the bar, so I said to Beyoncé, ‘Did she really bite you?’ She was like, ‘Yeah,’” the <a href=#>Girls Trip</a> actress, 38, recalled to the magazine. “I was like, ‘She gonna get her ass beat tonight.’ She was like, ‘Tiffany, no. Don’t do that. That bitch is on drugs. She not even drunk. The bitch is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sanaa-lathan-health-cover.jpg><p>Lathan was one of the first actresses to be accused of being the perpetrator after Twitter users narrowed down the list of attendees at the party in question. The&nbsp;<a href=#>Alien vs. Predator</a> star quickly shut down the accusations on March 26, tweeting, “Y’all are funny. Under no circumstances did I bite Beyoncé and if I did it would’ve been a love bite.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmZ6Wrm64wK2fmqZdqL2mrcqsZKitpGKuo7vUrWSamqOqv6V50a6kqKqjYsCpsYyboK1lkprGsLrCnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./195797-sada-baby-says-eminem-isnt-a-top-5-rapper-from-detroit-news.html><span>←</span><span>Sada Baby Says Eminem Isn't A Top 5 Rapper From Detroit</span></a>
