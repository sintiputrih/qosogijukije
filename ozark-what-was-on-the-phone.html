All hell breaks loose when everyone keeps suspiciously silent. What's on the phone screen?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 3, Episode 2 of 'Ozark' deals with high school bullying and manipulation, among other topics.</h2><p>Ben, Wendy's instinct-driven and restless brother, gets himself into considerable trouble in Season 3, Episode 2 of <a href=#>Ozark</a> after spotting the panicked and potentially humiliated teenage girl. But unfortunately, the creators deliberately steered away from showing what's on the phone screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Instead, the suspense-filled scene focused on Ben's reaction, zooming in on his attempt to stick up for the girl and teach the class a lesson. And teach a lesson he does. After learning that the kids have already seen the image causing the girl so much anguish, Ben confiscates everyone's phones. He then marches out of the school and chucks the goods into a conveniently-located wood chipper.</p><p>Unfortunately, the show hasn't revealed what the image was. But fans came up with numerous theories explaining why Ben may have chosen to go down this unusual route.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"My initial reaction (as a high school teacher myself) was that the class was circulating an incriminating or compromising photo of the girl who finally says, 'No!' when she sees it," a Redditor named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheMightyFro</a> wrote. "It makes sense that Ben would approach her so cautiously and with concern, only to flip out when he realized that everyone was looking at this girl, and to me at least, it explains him calling the entire class emotional terrorists and destroying the phones."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Several Ozark fans suspect that the photograph contained sexually explicit content.</p><p>"That episode of Ozark when Ben took all the students' cell phones and destroyed them because someone exposed the nudes of another classmate," tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SportNorfEast</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Others ventured even further, claiming the photograph could have cast the student and Ben in an unfavorable light.</p><p>"My impression of the whole scene initially was that it was possibly a sexual picture of him and the girl ....
