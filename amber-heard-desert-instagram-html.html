Actress Amber Heard left the big city behind her and headed to the desert to shoot some photos for the ‘gram. In a two photo series captioned, “Wandering…” Heard gave followers a look at her secluded getaway. The photos show Heard in a cozy throw over as she poses simply in front of Joshua trees and boulders, giving us the idea that she may be somewhere near Joshua Tree National Park."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In a two photo series captioned, “Wandering…” Heard gave followers a look at her secluded getaway. The photos show Heard in a cozy throw over as she poses simply in front of Joshua trees and boulders, giving us the idea that she may be somewhere near Joshua Tree National Park. Striking a serious, then smiling look, Amber Heard sports her deserty vibes complete with striking red nails. A quick look through recent posts reveal that perhaps she has been in the desert for a few days now. Her previous photo from just a few days ago depicts the actress in a jean jacket holding tightly to her 10 month old daughter, Oonagh Paige Heard. A shot of the back of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mother daughter duo</a>, the two are staring out into another expanse that looks an awful lot like the desert we are seeing here.&nbsp;</p><p>A talented actress with a solid career in Hollywood, Heard got her start nearly 20 years ago in the horror thriller, All the Boys Love Mandy Lane. She also stood out in late 2000s films, Never Back Down and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pineapple Express</a> as well as shining in 2009’s The Joneses. Heard took on several smaller roles and film flops before her career really launched in 2017 as an addition to the DC Universe. Throughout the course of DC films Justice League, Aquaman, and Zack Snyder’s Justice League, Amber Heard has stepped into the role of Atlantean queen, Mera. With Aquaman 2 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">now in post production</a>, we are another step closer to seeing Heard reprise her role as the red headed queen as well as the entirety of the long awaited sequel to the 2018 film.</p><p>Unfortunately for Amber Heard, most people now recognize her name because of the reports and drama surrounding her life with ex-husband, Johnny Depp. The pair originally tied the knot back in February 2015 after dating for three years. The marriage quickly began to show its cracks and the two separated in May of 2016. Immediately after filing for divorce, Heard stepped forward and petitioned a court for a restraining order against her ex-husband alleging that he had been both physically and verbally abusive to her throughout their four year relationship. Denying the allegations, <a href=#>Depp</a> slammed Heard claiming that she was hoping to gain a larger financial settlement. Following a highly publicized divorce hearing, the two released a joint statement that, among other things, solidified that neither of the pair “made false accusations for financial gain” and settled on Depp paying Heard $7 million of which she was to donate to the ACLU and the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. When it was discovered that the money was never donated, the drama picked up once again. Following a libel suit launched by Depp against Heard in 2018, Heard’s lawyers claimed in 2021 that the actress had been using the money from the original settlement to fight this new suit therefore not turning it over to the two foundations. Following another brutal time in court, Depp lost his claim with the court finding Amber Heard to be in the right once again.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of her up and down time surrounding the events between her and Depp, Amber Heard <a href=#>has suffered</a> a breakdown in her career. The battle still rages on between the two with Depp suing Heard for defamation once again in 2019, which is set to head to court in April 2022. Perhaps for this reason, the actress has headed to the desert to gain some quiet and solitude before journeying back into the real world for the next fight.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnkaKvpr6MoZyaqpRisaa%2FxKurZqGeqMGis9GapGegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./la-knight-throws-first-pitch-at-new-york-mets-game.html><span>←</span><span>LA Knight Throws First Pitch At New York Mets Game</span></a>
