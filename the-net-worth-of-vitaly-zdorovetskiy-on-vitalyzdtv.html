He has gained fame through his channel VitalyzdTv, boasting almost 10 million subscribers.</p><p>His successful career has earned him an estimated net worth of $2 million as of early 2018.</p><h3>VitalyzdTv’s Worth: $2 Million</h3><p>Vitaly initially lived in Odessa, Ukraine, before relocating with his family to Florida and graduating from Park Vista Community High School in 2010. Though once an avid skateboarder, an injury halted his skateboarding pursuits.</p><p>At the age of 18, he ventured into the adult film industry and appeared in a film for the Bang Bros company alongside Diamond Kitty. However, in 2011, he launched his YouTube channel, marking the beginning of his focus on a career as a YouTuber. His breakthrough came in 2012 with the upload of “Miami Zombie Attack Prank!”, inspired by a cannibal attack in Miami. The video received over 32 million views. The subsequent “Russian Hitman Prank” led to his arrest, further propelling him to stardom and increasing his net worth.</p><p>Encouraged by this success, he continued creating prank videos, such as “Extreme Homeless Man Makeover” and “Gold Digger Prank”, which further expanded his popularity and wealth. His growing influence led to his involvement with Studio71 and the production of the film “Natural Born Pranksters” alongside Roman Atwood and Dennis Roady, though the film was not well-received.</p><p>Despite this setback, Vitaly persevered with his YouTube career and has amassed over 1.4 billion views on his channel, significantly boosting his wealth. He also launched a second channel, VitalyzdTvSecond, and garnered almost two million subscribers and over 255 million views, further increasing his net worth.</p><p>In his personal life, Vitaly has encountered legal issues, including multiple arrests, such as the 2016 streaking incident at game 4 of the NBA Finals. He maintains a low-key romantic life and currently resides with his mother in Los Angeles, California.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Vitaly Zdorovetskiy</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 8 1992</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Murmansk, Russia</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>YouTube personality, vlogger, social media personality, actor, producer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Park Vista Community High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Russian-American</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Elena Vulitsky</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/Vitalyzdtv</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/vitalyzdtv</a></td></tr><tr><td>Google+</td><td>http://plus.google.com/117336960981250020343</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/vitalyzdtv/</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6014413/</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>“Miami Zombie Attack Prank!” (2012), “Pain & Gain” (2013), “Extreme Homeless Man Make-over” (2013), “Gold Digger Prank” (2015), “ATM Robbery Prank” (2014), “Chainsaw Massacre Prank” (2014), “Hard Right” (2014), “Natural Born Prankster” (2016)</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Good Day LA” (Fox morning show), “Bad Weather Films” (2014), “All In” (2013), “Prank Academy” (2016), “Hobro Vlogs” (2015), “YouTubers React” (2014), “GGN: Snoop Dogg’s Double G News Network” (2013)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br><br></p><p><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiroZ1do7K1edaoqa2gXaSzbsLIrZilsV2vsbC%2Bzq%2BcraubnsZuu81mraKskaHGu7DTr2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-last-of-us-henry-sam.html><span>←</span><span>Surprise: The Last of Us Introduces Henry and Sam Taking Aim At Joel</span></a>
