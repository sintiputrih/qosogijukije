Whatever the reasons are, sometimes even the people closest to us can sometimes drift far apart. But, when you do get to see them and talk for hours with them it feels great to reconnect. That is what Sampha is trying to convey on this track.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-dancing-circles-from-sampha>Listen To "Dancing Circles" From Sampha</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In an interview with Apple Music, he broke down what the meaning behind the song is and how it came to be. Sampha says, "I sort of freestyled some lyrics and came up with the dancing refrain." He goes on, "Then [I] had this idea of someone having a conversation with someone they hadn’t seen in a long time, and just remembering how good it is, how good it felt to dance with them." The production is also fitting for the track as it builds tension. But, it is not uncomfortable. It is a feeling of excitement that you finally get to see the person again that you have missed so much.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on this brand-new song from Sampha off of Lahai, "Dancing Circles?"
