The documentary, directed by Torquil Jones, follows Nepali mountaineer Nirmal “Nimsdai” Purja, commonly known as Nims Purja, in his goal to summit all 14 of the world’s 8000-meter peaks in a single climbing season.</p><p>Reinhold Messner, an Italian climber, was the first to summit all 14 of the world’s 8,000-meter peaks in 1986, although it took him 16 years. The record had been lowered to seven years by 2019.</p><p>Purja braved avalanches, dangerous weather, near-death encounters, and political impediments, among other things.</p><p>Nimsdai says, “Giving up is not in the blood, sir. It’s not in the blood.”</p><p>The tasks appeared difficult, but Nimsdai overcame them with pure tenacity and faith in his own ability. In six months and six days, he finished it.</p><h2>Nims Purja is a guest on Joe Rogan’s podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience.”</h2><p>Purja was unknown in the climbing world until he broke the speed record for climbing the world’s 14 tallest mountains.<br>The record-breaking climber was invited to Joe Rogan’s The Joe Rogan Experience podcast on March 9, 2022.</p><p>The Joe Rogan podcast features Nirmal Purja. In their nearly three-hour session, Rogan offered insightful questions to Purja, as he always does. Purja explained that he came up with the idea to climb 14 peaks and film it after understanding that he wanted to show the world that nothing was truly impossible.</p><p>He also wanted the mountaineering community to give the Sherpas the credit they deserved. He was a member of the UK’s special forces and was about to retire, but he left his well-paying job to pursue his dream of proving to the world that anything was possible.</p><p>Following that, he began raising funds for his projects, but this proved to be more difficult than it appeared.</p><p>He received a lot of rejections, and people told him flat out that he wouldn’t be able to do it. The climber revealed that he needed $2 million for the project, and he was so determined that he wrote a handwritten letter to Virgin Group CEO Richard Branson.</p><h2>Nims Purja’s Appearance Brings Joy to Fans</h2><p>Purja said that out of everything he went through, getting the funds was the most stressful part of his life, especially after quitting his job.</p><p>This is only a small portion of their two-hour talk. Purja posted to Twitter shortly after the episode went live to announce his attendance.<br>“All our followers have been waiting for this – Nimsdai on the Joe Rogan Experience!” wrote the climber. “Folks, get ready to be inspired, motivated, and start living rather than simply surviving – a must-listen podcast!”</p><p>Purja’s fans hailed him for his presence in the comments section.</p><p>“It is utter delight to view and listen to our national anthem in JRE,” one Nepali user remarked. “Who would have believed that one day we would be watching #nimsdai on JRE and hearing to our national hymn?”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiloqWjYr22vsmaZKimXam1pnnJqJxmqp%2Bcrq95xLGnnqqZmruksY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michelle-yeoh-pays-tribute-to-late-disney-star-coco-lee.html><span>←</span><span>Michelle Yeoh pays tribute to late Disney star CoCo Lee</span></a>
