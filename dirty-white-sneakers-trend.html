She also said that people who wore white sneakers looked as though they were walking around in potatoes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I hate to break it to you, Mom, but if you saw what I wear to the office every day, you'd gasp. Each morning, I stick to the same uniform: a minimal graphic T-shirt tucked into black tailored jogger-like trousers with a stretchy waistband and finished with a pair of dirty white shoes. Anyone in my office building who isn't a fashion editor likely wonders why I look so unpolished when they see me step inside the elevator. Of course, what they don't realize is that it's intentional.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to learn more about the questionable, yet undeniably popular, dirty shoes trend.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-dirty-shoe-trendsetters></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Dirty Shoe Trendsetters</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Pietro D'aprano / Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So why do I elect to wear dirt? Well, fashion houses like Balenciaga and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gucci</a>&nbsp;— who, in my mind, can do no wrong — showed ugly, scratched-up kicks that'll cost you upwards of $800. That's a lot of money, especially for something that's purposely designed to make you look unkempt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless, I want&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Balenciaga's Triple S Trainer</a>&nbsp;so badly. They're chic. They're capital-F fashion, and to put it plainly: I just think they're damn cool. Still, I'm not in a position to make that kind of investment this season. So, for now, I'm thanking the gods of fashion (hello, Demna Gvasalia and Alessandro Michele) for this trend.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-my-favorite-dirty-shoes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>My Favorite Dirty Shoes</span></h2><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qkKLMD7VWJDehqJjnFXrWbm1vSc=/840x840/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Stan_Smith_Shoes_White_Q47225_04-cd37de5fcdd3497b918091adbe158687.jpg" alt="Adidas Stan Smiths" width=840 height=840 url style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span class=mntl-sc-block-product__brand>Adidas</span> <span class=mntl-sc-block-product__style-name>Stan Smiths,</span> <span class=mntl-sc-block-product__prices><span class=mntl-sc-block-product__retail-price>$100.00</span></span></p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow nocaes" id=mntl-sc-block-product__button_1-0 class="mntl-sc-block-product__button mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><span class=link__wrapper>Shop</span></a><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Several years-old tattered and torn Adidas' Stan Smiths are one of my go-to pairs of dirty white shoes. After buying a pair, don't worry about&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>keeping these clean</a>. You want them to look worn, as if they were the footwear counterpart to destroyed denim.</p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PpYVMJcTULKl5a5zyKUTd2w2USQ=/840x840/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Superstar_Shoes_White_FV3285_04-d87838a9b6484e3aa2dad904ffd002f6.jpg" alt="Adidas Superstars" width=840 height=840 url style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span class=mntl-sc-block-product__brand>Adidas</span> <span class=mntl-sc-block-product__style-name>Superstars,</span> <span class=mntl-sc-block-product__prices><span class=mntl-sc-block-product__retail-price>$100.00</span></span></p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow nocaes" id=mntl-sc-block-product__button_2-0 class="mntl-sc-block-product__button mntl-text-link" data-tracking-container=true><span class=link__wrapper>Shop</span></a><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I've been wearing these dirty shoes regularly — before&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"ugly" shoes</a>&nbsp;were a thing. At $100, they're way more affordable than&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Balenciaga's Paris High Top Graffiti Sneaker</a>&nbsp;($950). When one pair really reaches the end of its lifespan, they can be easily replaced. To me, they match my uniform perfectly.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-final-thoughts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Final Thoughts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm very aware of the fact that choosing to not wear clean clothes isn't the most neat decision you can make. Your accessories tell a powerful story. Showing up to an important meeting with grime on your feet can, unfortunately, send the wrong, not-so-professional message.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, I'm choosing to rely on what fashion says we can do. For that reason, I'm keeping an eye on guys and gals with a little grit on their shoes, too. Be it Balenciaga, Gucci, Vetements, or Adidas, I'm crossing my fingers in the hope that soon, I won't be the only one who's opted to take the more relaxed, easier sartorial route.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After all, isn't the point of adopting and crafting a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>personal style</a>&nbsp;to break some rules and step away from the norm? Go ahead and tell me I should buy a new pair or try a little harder ... I don't care. I'll continue wearing my washed-up shoes — until clean is the new dirty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3y0tM6eqmicmafBunnWoaCtnV2ou6atyp6prGWkp7KvsA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./azio-retro-classic-mechanical-keyboard-review.html><span>←</span><span>The Azio Retro Classic Mechanical Keyboard</span></a>
