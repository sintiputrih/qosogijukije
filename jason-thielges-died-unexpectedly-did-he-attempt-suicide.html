Prayers to Jason Thielges’ family, and to all his Viking brothers from VCSU. They were some of my first students when I came to VCSU.

After knowing of Jason’s suicide attempts, his death became a mystery for the entire community, and many of his well-known relatives refused to believe that he had committed suicide.
