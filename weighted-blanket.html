A weighted blanket is a heavier blanket made with multiple layers that contain minuscule glass or ceramic beads and is often used to help people relax. These blankets are often used by therapists on anxious or depressed patients and use the theory that their weight or pressure on the body can bring a sense of calm (like a hug) and ultimately help you fall into a deeper, more comfortable sleep."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

However, there are a lot of weighted blankets on the market right now, so it can be an ordeal to make the buying decision. That's why we've created this buyer's guide to help you find the finest weighted blanket for your needs.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Benefits of Weighted Blankets</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here are some of the benefits of weighted blankets:</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Provide deep pressure therapy</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Weighted blankets provide deep pressure stimulation – a type of gentle touch that gives the user a sense of calm and feeling similar to a tight hug. As soon as you crawl under the heavy blanket, it creates a calming modality throughout your body that improves your mood and helps you relax.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Reduce stress and anxiety</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>DPS can also help reduce anxiety and improve moods by lowering cortisol levels, which are hormones released during times of stress. It has been found to reduce symptoms in people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Ease insomnia</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>When you feel the warmth of a weighted blanket, it increases the level of melatonin in the body. Melatonin is a hormone that promotes peaceful sleep and regulates sleep patterns. An increased level can help people with insomnia or sleep anxiety fall asleep soundly and peacefully. The infused beads in the blanket also apply gentle pressure that helps to decrease the symptoms of restless leg syndrome.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>How to Choose the Right Weighted Blanket?</span></h3><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Weight</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>A blanket that is heavier than necessary won't be comfortable to use. However, if you feel like the pressure of the blanket isn't enough, it won't help you calm down.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>To get a good night's sleep with your weighted blanket, make sure to choose the right weight according to your body weight. More precisely, the weight of the blanket should be 10% of your body weight. So, if you weigh around 140 pounds, then you should opt for a 14-pound blanket. The best part is weighted blankets are available in a wide weight range, so you can easily pick one that best suits your specific needs.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Size</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>In addition to weight, it's important to consider size when purchasing a weighted blanket. Many companies sell weighted blankets with different dimensions, so it is recommended to choose the same size as the mattress you sleep on.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Pattern</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Once you have measured your bed, it's time to decide what color/pattern you want on your weighted blanket. From cloud gray to light purple, these blankets are available in many distinctive colors and patterns. If you prefer minimalist bedding, then a solid-colored blanket with a streamlined design might work well for you. However, if you want something that stands out more and makes a statement, then a peach or aqua-colored patterned weighted blanket would be perfect!</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Inner layer</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Most weighted blankets are made with small plastic or non-toxic glass beads inside. These beads can shift around and make noise when the blanket is moved, which can be distracting while sleeping. It is important to opt for a blanket with at least two layers of microfibers to prevent movement and leakage of these beads.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Outer layer</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>The outer layer of a weighted blanket will determine how soft, warm, and breathable it is and how easy it is to wash. These blankets are available in different materials such as cotton, fleece, minky dot fabric, and even microfiber! Fleece and flannel are both soft and plush fabrics, but cotton tends to be more breathable. Before buying, it is important to ensure that the blanket is made of hypoallergenic material so it won’t irritate your skin. Also, look for a cover that's made with machine-washable fabric for easy care, and remember that you'll probably want to buy more than one cover so you can switch them out between washes.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Tips to Clean a Weighted Blanket</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Weighted blankets are often low maintenance, but they can easily get dirty from regular use. If your weighted blanket is starting to look dingy or smells like mildew, you can freshen it up in the washing machine with these simple tips.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Read the care label</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Don't just pull it out of the packaging and toss it in the washing machine because some weighted blankets require special care. For example, some are filled with plastic "microbeads" that can melt in hot water. Others could easily be damaged by the agitator in a washing machine. Most weighted blankets come with washing instructions. These will tell you if your blanket is machine washable and what temperature to wash at. You may also be able to find washing instructions on the manufacturer's website.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Use cold water</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wash your blanket in cold water to avoid damaging the fabric or shrinking the blanket. Warm or hot water may shrink your blanket and affect its weight distribution (making it uncomfortable).</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Use gentle laundry detergent</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Avoid detergents that contain bleach or are highly fragranced, as they may irritate sensitive skin. If you have allergies, consider using a laundry detergent that is free of dyes and perfumes.</span></p><h4><span style=font-weight:400>Dry your blanket on low heat</span></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since high heat can damage the filling inside your blanket and make it less durable over time, it is important to tumble dry on low heat or air dry.</span></p><h3><span style=font-weight:400>Cost of a Weighted Blanket</span></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The cost of a weighted blanket depends on the size, weight, and material. The bigger the blanket, the more it will cost. A standard adult weighted blanket made of cloud-like Egyptian cotton that weighs 15 pounds costs approximately $100 to $300. A good, weighted blanket will last you years, so if it helps you sleep better and reduce anxiety, it could be well worth the investment. However, if you have budgetary constraints, there are other affordable blankets that cost around $60 but provide you with the same warmth and relaxing sensation.</span></p><h2 class=review-faqs__title>People Also Asked</h2>Is it okay to sleep under a weighted blanket?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, absolutely! Weighted blankets provide deep touch pressure (DTP) therapy that is similar to the feeling of being hugged or swaddled. This type of pressure helps calm your nervous system and release the feel-good hormone oxytocin, enabling you to relax and fall asleep faster.</span></p>Is it okay to iron a weighted blanket?<p><span style=font-weight:400>No, you shouldn't iron your weighted blanket! Ironing will flatten out the filling in your weighted blanket, rendering it completely useless.&nbsp;</span></p>Is a weighted blanket safe for toddlers?<p><span style=font-weight:400>No, weighted blankets can be bulky and cumbersome. So, you should never give them to infants or children under the age of 2 unless recommended by a pediatrician.&nbsp;</span></p><img width=64 height=64 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HL_social.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a href=# title="Posts by HollywoodLife Reviews" class="author url fn" rel=author>HollywoodLife Reviews</a> HollywoodLife For over a decade Hollywood Life has been a leading source of celebrity, entertainment, and pop culture news.
