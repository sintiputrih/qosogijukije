Doug touched the lives of many of us during our time at JM, and his memory will forever hold a special place in our hearts.</p><p>Doug was not just a teacher but a mentor, a colleague, and most importantly, a genuine friend. Many of us had the privilege of being his students in high school, where he taught us the wonders of Sports Biology. He had a unique way of making learning both fun and engaging, leaving an indelible mark on us. Doug’s class was often a favorite, and we cherished the knowledge and wisdom he shared.</p><p>After our college years, some of us had the opportunity to work alongside Doug as mentor teachers. He continued to inspire and guide us, not only in the classroom but in life. His dedication to education and his passion for teaching were evident in everything he did.</p><p>I had the pleasure of becoming a colleague of his at JM, and those moments spent working together are cherished memories. Doug was more than just a coworker; he was a friend who would go out of his way to offer support and share a good laugh. I recently bumped into him at Fleet Farm, and we enjoyed a 30-minute conversation filled with laughter and promises to meet again soon. Little did I know it would be our last encounter.</p><p>Doug Ondler’s passing is a great loss to JM, and he will forever be remembered as one of our legends. His dedication, kindness, and the positive impact he had on countless lives will continue to inspire us.</p><p>As we come to terms with this sorrowful news, let us remember the joy and laughter he brought into our lives. Let us celebrate the time we had with him and honor his memory by carrying forward the lessons he taught us. Doug’s legacy lives on in each one of us, and he will always be missed.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwsM6unmannpm5pr6MqJmirKWWv7p5w6isoGWfo7GtsdFmn5qrXaWutL%2FEnWSar5GufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-bowie-cat-people-putting-out-the-fire-lyrics.html><span>←</span><span>David Bowie Cat People (Putting Out The Fire) Lyrics</span></a>
