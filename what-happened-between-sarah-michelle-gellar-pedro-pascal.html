The flashback photo was actually a still from that episode in season 4. At that time, the 20-year-old actor was still credited for his character as Pedro Balmaceda. It came from his full name, José Pedro Balmaceda Pascal. This was long before his "daddy" days, as well as Gellar's "Mother" era, which she recently owned by using the title in her Instagram bio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Cruel Intentions actress has recently embraced her gay icon status after the resurgence of her cult classics. Thanks to longtime fans like the self-proclaimed Sarah Michelle Gellar historian, Evan Ross Katz who released a book called, Into Every Generation a Slayer Is Born: How Buffy Staked Our Hearts in 2022. Now a friend of Gellar's, the author actually came up with the idea of posting the Buffy throwback.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fqyjx5daqaajjoz.jpeg><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram carousel</a> posted in light of the viral photo, Katz shared a screenshot of his conversation with the actress. "Also I have an IG post idea for you," he texted, to which the <a href=#>Scooby-Do star</a> replied, "Go for it." The writer then pitched: "I think you should do a still from your scene with Pedro on BTVS," noting that "It's repeatedly gone viral on Twitter amid the Pedroaissance." Gellar agreed, saying, "Ok I will do man crush Monday."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Katz captioned the post: "Never expected that my random text to SMG suggesting she post a throwback to her BUFFY scene with Pedro Pascal would spawn a whole news cycle. And believe me, I'm not complaining!"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Look At Pedro Pascal And Oscar Isaac's Hilarious Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=pedro-pascal-on-working-with-sarah-michelle-gellar>Pedro Pascal On Working With Sarah Michelle Gellar</h2><p>Pascal later responded to the trending throwback picture while speaking to Access Hollywood during the season 3 premiere of Disney Plus' The Mandalorian in Los Angeles. "What I just found out – that I am very excited about, and I can't wait to get my phone back so that I can look it up myself – is that Sarah Michelle Gellar remembers me," said <a href=#>Game of Thrones' Oberyn Martell</a>.</p><p>"I want her to know that I remember every moment of shooting that episode, as brief as it was. She was such a kind scene partner, and we had the best time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pascal was also shown a photo of himself from that episode, which he still remembers so well. "This is Eddie, and the episode is The Freshman. It's the Season 4 premiere," he said of the image, noting that "it was a super big deal" for him at that time. Gellar later responded to his interview on her Instagram story. "As if I could ever forget you,” she wrote. "I adore you."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar52330316.jpg><p>Despite having a complete recollection of that gig, Pascal has a "hazy" memory of the moment he got his role in HBO's new series, The Last of Us. "It is a bit hazy because I had stayed up very late meeting everyone and was very excited, so I took a sleeping tablet," he recently told the Graham Norton Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When they called to offer me the part, I was so drowsy they had to repeat the offer," he added. "I then forgot that completely and when I woke up the following morning, I thought because of the time difference between London and LA, I would be waiting by the phone all day to hear if I got the job!"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sarah Michelle Gellar Wasn't The Best Actor On Buffy The Vampire Slayer, According To Fans</a></span></p><h2 id=sarah-michelle-gellar-on-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-39-s-39-extremely-toxic-male-set-39>Sarah Michelle Gellar On Buffy The Vampire Slayer's 'Extremely Toxic Male Set'</h2><p>Although Pascal and Gellar have fond memories of their time on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the latter recently spilled the truth about <a href=#>its "extremely toxic male set."</a> During a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">roundtable at TheWrap's</a> Power Of Women Summit in December 2022, she said:</p><p>"For so long, I was on a set that I think was known for being an extremely toxic male set, and so that was ingrained in my head that that was what all sets were like, and that women were pitted against each other – that if women became friends, then we became too powerful, so you had to keep that down"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar52383475.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Wolf Pack star</a> — who is <a href=#>against doing a Buffy reboot</a> — added that it taught her to be more mindful about picking the right projects.</p><p>"And now that I've had this opportunity to work with so many more women and men that support women as well, I realized how easy an experience it can be," she said.
