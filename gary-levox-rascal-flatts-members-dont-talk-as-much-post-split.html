The tour was later canceled due to <a href=#>the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p><p>The “What Hurts the Most” singer told Us that he, DeMarcus, 51, and Rooney, 47, “haven’t had any conversations” about reviving the farewell event, but that it’s “not really off the table.” He added, “I don’t know what the future holds but, you know, for now I’m just having a blast and … I think <a href=#>Jay and Joe Don are doing their thing</a>. … So, we’ll see. Who knows?”</p><p>For now, the Ohio native, who shares daughters Brittany, 22, and Brooklyn, 18, with wife <strong>Tara Vernon</strong>, is focused on his solo career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gary-LaVox-Gives-Rascal-Flatts-Update.jpg><p>“It’s all about the music,” he told Us. “After doing it so long with Flatts, and just the way that whole thing ended and all that, I was just ready to go, you know? And <a href=#>new seasons and new journeys</a> are good for careers. … I’m working more than I thought I was going to or than I really wanted to … but now we’re here, let’s just go, you know?”</p><p>The “Bless the Broken Road” singer added that his <a href=#>daughters are both singers</a> as well. “It blows my mind how gifted and talented that they are. … They just have undeniable talent,” he said. When it comes to parenting, LeVox and his wife have different styles.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gary-LaVox-Gives-Rascal-Flatts-Update-2.jpg><p>“Dads are different because … it doesn’t take so much <a href=#>energy for us to correct our children</a>. … Like, I can look at ’em or something and go, ‘Are you serious?’ … [Whereas] Tara would have to sit there and talk for 30 minutes on why it was wrong,” he shared.</p><p>The “Get Down Like That” musician, who has been married to Vernon since 1998, told Us that “keeping God at the center” of the relationship has been him and his wife’s “anchor point.” They also haven’t lost <a href=#>their sense of romance</a>. “Little Olive Garden on a Wednesday,” he joked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagmaKueq2x1aivZqqRqLCiuIyfo5qspKh6rrHMm5yrq12ZvK%2FAjK2YpaNdlsBuudScn2aon6jBbr%2FPpaCtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./253533-billie-eilish-shares-rare-bikini-shots-during-hawaii-vacation-news.html><span>←</span><span>Billie Eilish Shares Rare Bikini Shots During Hawaii Vacation</span></a>
