And caused significant damage, toppling chimneys hundreds of miles away in Chicago. It happened far away from today’s quake in Hamilton County, along the border with Indiana.<a href=#> A 2.7-magnitude earthquake happened near there around two months ago. A 2.6 earthquake struck between St. Louis and Hamilton County just two weeks ago</a>.</p><p><a href=#>The Illinois Department of Natural Resources says that</a> serious damage from earthquakes happens every 70 to 90 years. Devastating earthquakes are rare in the Midwest, happening every 700 to 1200 years.</p><p>One of the most active seismic zones in the US is located in southern Missouri’s boot heel along the borders of Arkansas, Illinois, and Tennessee. It is called the New Madrid Seismic Zone and small earthquakes radiate from there on a near-daily basis. Some of the largest earthquakes ever recorded in the US happened there between 1811 and 1812 and could be felt as far away as New York City. <a href=#>The largest one of them was magnitude 8.8 and had the Mississippi River running backwards, cracks opening up in the ground, smog, and sand boils</a>.</p><span class=icon>Close Modal</span><h3 class=modal__dialog-title>Suggest a Correction</h3>Suggest a Correction<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmien61%2Fr7vWZ5qopV%2Bjsri%2FjqKjpaGepLa0e86dm2ZrXWt6rq3Gp6CtrZSaeqat0a2fqq2RoLJuv8eaop6rXaO8s8DHZpqepqSnrq15yKWjoqafnsBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-wicked-shape-the-liberian-woman-who-embarked-on-twerk-a-thon-for-3-hours.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Wicked Shape, the Liberian lady who embarked on twerk-a-thon for 3 hours</span></a>
