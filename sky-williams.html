He began struggling with depression in the sixth grade, which further increased with his fellow students, many of whom actively bullied him. The time he figured out that he was homosexual and in trying to keep from shaming his family, made a promise to keep it a secret, forever. He found it in playing video games, most notably the video game Super Smash Brothers.</p><p>His interest in games led to his fascination with competitive online video gaming and his struggle to be the best at the game. He began participating in gaming tournaments, every weekend. Throughout this time he even got involved in improvised humor, as a hobby, which ultimately became part of his career. He finds his first comedy through a talent show victory in his high school. At that point, he concluded that he would grow up to become a comedian.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Willams is a YouTube gamer, stand-up comedian, and vlogger.

He also reacts to Reddit memes.</p><p>After winning a talent show at school, he went to his mother to tell her that he aims to become a comedian.
