Fortunately for us, that gives us plenty of opportunities for the <a href=#>White Lotus</a> star to show off her <a href=#>famously toned body</a>, including a recent Instagram post in which she allows her gown to all but slip off her shoulders. Alexandra Daddario is a particularly active and popular celebrity on <a href=#>social media</a> (with her <a href=#>Instagram</a> alone having nearly 23 million followers) and with posts like these, it is clear why.&nbsp;</p><p>In her latest Instagram post, Alexandra Daddario is standing at the gates of a courtyard garden, presumably a shooting location for <a href=#>Mayfair Witches</a> in Anne Rice’s beloved New Orleans. She is wearing a long, light blue dress with a diaphanous skirt, likely still in costume from her role as brilliant neurosurgeon Rowan Fielding, with the dress falling nearly completely off her shoulders. It is the kind of image you might expect to see on the cover of a gothic romance novel, and Alexandra Daddario is certainly pulling it off.</p><p>The second photo in the carousel is of Alexandra Daddario’s daily commute to work, showing one side of a vertical lift bridge framed against a brilliant Louisiana sky at sunset (or possibly sunrise, depending on whether she’s going to or coming from the set). It would be easy to comment that celebrities are just like anyone else, and there truly is no social equalizer like a daily commute.</p><p>The third and final picture in Alexandra Daddario’s set removes the actress from the equation entirely, instead giving us a very enigmatic outline of a gecko against a wall. Although Daddario is starring in a series about witches, Anne Rice’s books largely did not concern the kind of witches who cook up cauldrons of newt eyes and various body parts, so this particular lizard can probably consider itself safe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/anne-rices-mayfair-witches-screencap-trailer-900x506.jpg><p>The series premiere of <a href=#>Mayfair Witches</a> was released just this last weekend as part of AMC’s ambitious new plan to build a shared universe known as the “Immortal Universe,” based on the works of Anne Rice. Alexandra Daddario is anchoring Mayfair Witches alongside Jack Huston, Harry Hamlin, and Beth Grant. The story concerns a San Francisco doctor who discovers she is connected to a family of powerful magic users and the spirit that has haunted them for centuries.</p><p>Mayfair Witches is the second series in the Immortal Universe, following Interview with the Vampire starring Jacob Anderson, Sam Reid, and Bailey Bass as a trio of vampires with a&nbsp;dysfunctional family bond. The Alexandra Daddario series will likely crossover with Interview with the Vampire at some point, as many of Anne Rice’s characters interact in the novels. We shall just have to wait and see how long AMC’s noble new experiment lasts.</p><p>At least for now, we are glad that Alexandra Daddario is enjoying both her bare shoulders and her daily commute. We certainly are.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnkaGyua3NnamaZZSWsaWt0aKmZpqRp7KtxYyhpqWcXaq9b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leah-smith.html><span>←</span><span>Leah Smith Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
