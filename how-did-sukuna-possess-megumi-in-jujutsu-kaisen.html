This special-grade curse is a tough nut to crack. The toughest, some may say, especially when in control of a vessel that doesn’t put up nearly as much of a fight as Yuji Itadori did.</p><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=791 data-injectable=true>Currently, the King of Curses is in possession of Megumi Fushiguro’s body, and he has not been shy about using the sorcerer’s techniques to accomplish his goals. In all honesty, why would he? Victory is victory, no matter how one goes about achieving it. That said, there is one thing that Megumi fans cannot forgive, and that is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the character’s potential demise</a>, which is looking more and more likely by the day. Especially after the events of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chapter 237</a>.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>In it, readers witness Sukuna completely take over Megumi’s body, in a way that we didn’t even think would be possible. But as we recover from the collective <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">trauma that recent chapters have put us through</a>, it’s time for a trip down memory lane, for those who have already forgotten exactly how Sukuna managed to get himself a new vessel.</p><h2 id=h-how-did-sukuna-take-over-megumi data-injectable=false>How did Sukuna take over Megumi?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sukuna-e1659551089114.jpg><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>Sukuna forcibly possessed Megumi’s body in chapter 212 of Jujutsu Kaisen. Upon seeing his sister Tsumiki being controlled by Yorozu, Megumi entered a state of shock, freezing for the few precious moments that allowed Sukuna to get the upper hand.</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>Making use of the pact he made with Itadori in the Fearsome Womb arc, the cursed spirit took control of their shared body for a minute, and the first thing he did was incapacitate Kurusu. Then, Sukuna tore off one of his vessel’s fingers, embedding cursed energy into it before advancing on Megumi. Before the sorcerer could attack, Sukuna forcefully fed him his detached finger, thus transferring his consciousness and cursed energy from Yuji’s body to Megumi’s.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>After the possession, Megumi tried to put up a fight, by interfering with Sukuna’s cursed energy, but that didn’t last for too long. The spirit underwent a ritual to bury Megumi’s soul even further, and after killing Yorozu and Tsumiki, that goal was easily achieved. With the knowledge of his sister’s death, the sorcerer’s soul was fully buried in evil as he succumbed to Sukuna’s possession at last.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>Does all of this mean that Megumi’s soul and body are truly gone? We don’t really know for now, but as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the manga draws closer to the end</a>, hope among fans is understandably diminishing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6mmKefkWS1sMOMnaCdZaOquLa6wGanqKujmsC0ecyenq6lmWK2r3nJrqGurKOqeqytyKycp2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christopher-diaz.html><span>←</span><span>Christopher Diaz- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Career</span></a>
