Recently revealing the bombshell news that she has an infant daughter, Byler went radio silent when asked to divulge additional details about her little girl — refusing to identify 19-month-old's father on part two of TLC's reunion show Breaking Amish: The Shunning Truth.
However, as Byler explained to reunion host Michelle Beadle, it's not just a personal choice to withhold information. &#34;"><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

"That is my daughter, but she is not on the show. She is part of my private life, therefore I cannot talk about her," Byler said when Beadle showed a photo of Byler, her daughter and her husband <strong>Abe Schmucker</strong> taken before Breaking Amish filming began. (Fans have long speculated that Schmucker is the child's father, a claim he also refuses to address.)</p><p>"There's legal issues involved, so I don't have the privilege of talking about it. I'm sorry that I'm a mom and trying to protecting my kid. I don't give a s–t what anybody thinks. I don't have to answer to anybody," she continued. (Byler allegedly filed to divorce North Dakota's Rufus Hostetler in July 2012.)</p><p>Byler's new husband Schmucker — whom she wed in a traditional Amish ceremony in their Pennsylvania hometown on the show's finale — begged Breaking Amish viewers to leave their family alone and stop asking questions about the child.</p><p>"That's what upsets me — like Rebecca said, that's her daughter. People are talking about [the baby and] people that had nothing to do with the show," Schmucker fumed. "Involving family that does not need to be involved — that are going to have their lives ruined for what we're doing. That aggravates me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmrnZGgtq%2BzjJqkoquYqHqzscGempyZXaGyqK3LZqCsq6WawG680Z6tnqakYrqmecWrpqZlpJa5rLXNoGSamp%2BqwW652Gabmq2XncGmvoxrZ2pqYW5%2Bcns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brendan-unkrich.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Alfonso Ribeiros Wife Angela Unkrich?
