For some – typically those with an appetite for powder days and frozen early-morning chairlifts – it’s all about high altitude and deep snow cover. For the romantics among us, car-free streets, wooden chalets twinkling at dusk and fine-dining restaurants serving hearty mountain fare are key.</p><p>The more practical traveller might look for ski schools, an efficient lift system and convenient transport connections when choosing a winter sports destination. Others, with their eyes set on clocking up leg-burning distances, might favour piste maps bursting with opportunity.</p><p>To help settle the debate once and for all, we turned to data science to reveal the world’s best resorts, according to the facts and figures that form the foundations of ski holidays. Firstly, The Telegraph’s ski experts compiled a shortlist of 50 fantastic resorts, before sizing them up against one another across 36 criteria in four main categories: Location, Mountain Terrain, Resort Luxuries and Natural Prowess.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve assessed everything from vertical drop to après vigour, leaving no snowflake unturned in our search for perfection on the pistes. Our research stretched to every corner of the globe, from the depths of British Columbia and the powder fields of Japan via the heights of the Alps and wilderness of Scandinavia. It was a closely fought affair, with the top 10 resorts separated by a mere 100 points, and the top three by fewer than 50 – and there are some surprise exclusions as well as expected triumphs. Nevertheless, the winner is undeniably a worthy one – it is, after all, one of the most extensive, enticing and exciting ski destinations on the planet.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/travel/2022/11/10/zeller-best-ski-sq.jpg> <span></span><h2>Zell am See, Austria</h2>(Total score: <span>828</span>) <span></span><p>“Zell is a real one-off: a resort town with a traffic-free medieval centre and lovely lakeside setting that’s as busy in summer as in winter.

Officially named Zell am See-Kaprun, the resort is sandwiched between a giant lake and the local mountain (the Schmittenhöhe). There’s a train station at its heart, Salzburg Airport is just 80 minutes’ drive away and the town’s gastronomy scene (over 180 restaurants on and off the mountain) earned it top rankings in our Location and Luxuries categories. But it was Zell’s connections on the slopes and expanding ski area that propelled it into our top 10. The resort’s lift pass extends to nearby Kaprun and the Kitzsteinhorn glacier (surpassing 3,000m altitude), and thanks to the recent linking, by gondola and bus, to the 270km <a href=#>Saalbach-Hinterglemm-Leogang-Fieberbrunn</a> ski area, and the wider Skicircus ski area beyond that (totaling over 400km of pistes and 121 heavy-weight lifts), its credentials have skyrocketed. Access for skiers to a swimming pool, spa, kids club, a plethora of ski schools (16) and the town’s charm rating among our experts helped bolster its score further.</p><figure itemscope data-test=longform-body-image-align itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Zell am See-Kaprun’s lift pass extends to nearby Kaprun and the Kitzsteinhorn glacier</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: KORBINIAN SEIFERT/Zell am See-Kaprun Tourismus</span></figure><span></span><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Holiday&nbsp;highlight</h2><p>The two black runs down the front of Zell’s local Schmittenhöhe mountain are great fast blasts when groomed – which they usually are every night.

The 3,500sqm wellness area is set over three floors with various pools, different types of saunas and steam rooms, an outdoor hot tub, Feng-Shui garden and more.

Luxuries are where <a href=#>Lech</a> excelled in our study (missing out on second place in the category by just one point.) It’s home to more luxury hotels than any other of our top 10 (78) and a score of 30 for the prominence of Gault Milau listings among its restaurants (second only to <a href=#>Zermatt</a>). The resort’s performance in the terrain category is not to be sniffed at either – while the local slopes (115km) aren’t earthshattering, its place within the Arlberg ski area saw the resort gain high marks for access to heli-skiing, 13 ski schools and over 80 high-speed lifts, which granted it a top rating for lack of queues. Luxuries and terrain aside, Lech’s roster of famous patrons, including Princess Diana and the Dutch royal family, are drawn by the resort’s long-standing reputation as one of the snowiest destinations in the Alps – it was awarded an impressive number of points for average snowfall (431cm) and snow depth record (220cm).</p><figure itemscope data-test=longform-body-image-align itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Five-star dining is prominent in Lech’s hotels and restaurants</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Daniel Zangerl</span></figure><span></span><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Holiday&nbsp;highlight</h2><p>Enjoy après-ski with a difference, sipping artisanal gin and tonics in the intimate fire-warmed comfort of The Yurt, a hand-stitched Kyrgyz yurt set in the garden of the Hotel Arlberg.&nbsp;</p><p>Inghams (01483 945 143; <a href=#>inghams.co.uk</a>) offers Hotel Arlberg, widely regarded to be the best hotel in the resort, from £2,869 a week.

And what slopes. As well as the virtually year-round snow of the Grande Mötte glacier, its runs are challenging at every level, from long thigh-burning blues to epic backcountry routes. While restaurants and accommodation are constantly improving there is still a relaxed, unflashy vibe to resort life that skiers of all abilities know and love.”</p><span></span><p class=t-travel-expert>Chris Madigan, TELEGRAPH DESTINATION EXPERT</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>What is it like?</h2><p>Consider a ski holiday in <a href=#>Tignes</a> and your attention will be blinded by the resort’s reputation as one of the most snow-sure destinations in Europe – an accolade that shot the French hotspot up the rankings. The resort’s altitude, topping out in the highest village of Val Claret at 2,100m, scoring it a stack of points, as did possessing one of longest seasons in our study (163 days) and the best average snowfall of any French destination (590cm). Its ski area, which reaches an eye-watering 3,456m on the Grand Mötte glacier, is hard to beat for variety (300km shared with <a href=#>Val d’Isère</a>) and vertical drop (1,956m). Despite its lofty credentials though, the resort performed well for travel convenience (Bourg St Maurice train station is just 30km away) and gained bonuses for off-the-slope facilities such as Le Lagon waterpark, kids club and its commitment to sustainability, boosted further by its location at the heart of the Vanoise National Park (30 points).</p><figure itemscope data-test=longform-body-image-align itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>On-mountain dining comes with snow-sure views in Tignes</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Andy Parant</span></figure><span></span><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Holiday&nbsp;highlight</h2><p>If the main resort is a little brutalist for you, Tignes Les Brevières offers a more villagey feel for lunch or as a base – find both at Tetras Lodge Hotel.</p><p>Peak Retreats (023 9283 9310; <a href=#>peakretreats.co.uk</a>) offers Hotel Village Montana, including return Eurotunnel crossing, from £1,240.

The resort came second only to powder-haven Niseko when investigating snow depth records and with a season that spans November-May (170 days) it performed well for natural prowess. At the head of the Belleville Valley, surrounded by a horseshoe of dramatic peaks, Val Thorens is truly spectacular in winter. It’s made all the more enticing by the size of its ski area (150km local; 600km linked) and the facilities available to winter-sport enthusiasts – 160 lifts, 13 ski schools and a dedicated beginners area. The resort’s reputation for luxury is less well documented, but an ongoing five-star makeover thanks to a roster of new hotels and fine-dining establishments helped it stay afloat in the Luxuries category – it did particularly well for après-ski appeal (48 bars plus a bonus for a Folie Douce venue) and received additional points for off-the-slope activities – all adding up to a ski holiday with heightened appeal.</p><figure itemscope data-test=longform-body-image-align itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Visitors to Val Thorens have a host of activities to try, including Le Bee zipline</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: L.BROCHOT/OT Val Thorens</span></figure><span></span><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Holiday&nbsp;highlight</h2><p>Fly high above Europe’s loftiest resort on two zipwires.

It excelled in the Location category in particular. With the resort’s highest village sitting at 1,970m, a train station less than 40km away and the bonus of car-free streets, it’s hard to deny its appeal to those looking for snow-sure convenience, particularly families. Despite having an impressive 225km of its own terrain, the giant Paradiski area (425km) helped La Plagne punch above its rivals, thanks largely to a vertical drop of 2,000m and extensive lift system (129), including the double-decker Vanoise Express, which spans a 1,800m valley to connect the resort with <a href=#>Les Arcs</a>. The sheer size of the ski area and vastness of the resort means La Plagne earned points for an impressive number of restaurants both on (20) and off the slopes (99) – this is where it gained the most recognition in the Luxuries category. It fared better in terms of natural prowess, thanks to its location in the Vanoise National Park and a trustworthy snow record (477cm on average).

Linked to neighbouring <a href=#>Tignes</a> to form a ski area of 300km of pistes and 78 lifts, Val offers high quality, snow-sure slopes for everyone from complete beginner to veteran powderhound. Access to the Grand Mötte glacier, at 3,456m, makes it one of the loftiest ski areas in Europe, all backed up by the support of an impressive amount of ski schools (16), snow depth record within the top 10 (270cm) and an efficient lift system that saw it score bonus points for a lack of queues. What sets Val apart from its neighbour (ranked just three places behind) was its performance in the Luxuries category. The resort, which stretches for three miles along a narrow plateau flanked by steep mountains on both sides, from La Daille to the hamlets of Le Laisinant and Le Fornet at the foot of the Col de l’Iseran, is home to a growing number of luxury hotels (14 above four-star) and to the original incarnation of the on-mountain cabaret experience, the Folie Douce – which helped Val performed particularly well for the number of après-ski establishments (30).

With such a world-renowned reputation it would be easy for the resort to rest on its laurels&nbsp; – but it’s the luxuries of a ski holiday where Zermatt excels with finesse. The Swiss bolthole topped the Luxuries category by a country mile, with more Michelin Stars or Gault Millau than any other resort in our study, a place in the top three for après appeal and as the top-ranking Swiss resort for plus-four-star luxury beds. The resort boasts impressive natural prowess too – scoring a total of 213 points in that category alone, helped largely by bonuses for its unequivocal charm and a season that spans 181 days. Zermatt’s ski area (360km) has no issue catering for such a long season thanks to the glacier it shares with <a href=#>Cervinia</a>, across the border in Italy, and which reaches a staggering 3,899m (the loftiest skiable point in our study).

The resort is home to four separate mountains, all with their own ski area and connected by a free shuttle bus – in total its skiable area covers 515km of slopes with a top height of 3,813m. Despite having one of the most expensive lift passes in our study, the resort grants access to all the thrills on every skier’s list, from heli-skiing, cross country tracks (96km) and terrain parks (12) – all with the luxury of non-existent queues. Aspen’s location is almost as impressive as its ski area – sitting at 2,560m it’s higher than any resort in Europe (beware of altitude sickness), and there’s an airport just 4km away. Naturally, its geography is just as staggering. As part of the Rocky Mountain National Park (bonus point) the average snowfall surpasses 700cm. Glamorous and fashionable, off the slopes Aspen is a delight, with 100 restaurants, spas, a swimming pool and all the indulgence that makes an American ski holiday great.</p><figure itemscope data-test=longform-body-image-align itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The Woody Creek Tavern is just one of over 100 restaurants and bars in Aspen</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Alamy Stock Photo</span></figure><span></span><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Holiday&nbsp;highlight</h2><p>Take a taxi to Woody Creek Tavern, haunt of late gonzo journalist Hunter S.

While some might loathe the jagged architecture and apartment blocks that others love, the formula work and <a href=#>Les Arcs</a>’ position on the podium is proof enough. The resort, which is split across four ski-in/ski-out bases at 1,600m, 1,800m, 1,950m and 2,000m, offers something for every type of skier and snowboarder. You’d be hard-pressed to be disappointed by its score in our Location category – the nearest train station (16km) is accessed directly by funicular lift and the streets are traffic free. But it is Les Arcs’ performance on the pistes that have secured it the silver medal – clocking up 451 points in the Terrain category alone. The ski area, which it shares with <a href=#>La Plagne</a> (ranked sixth) is an Alpine heavyweight with 425km in total and a high point of 3,226m. Three terrain parks, 30km of cross-country tracks, 14 ski schools and a dedicated beginners area means, across the vast area, it’s hard to get bored. When in the resort the variety is just as mindblowing: 124 restaurants, 38 bars, including a Folie Douce, swimming pool, spa, kids activities… the list is endless – much like Les Arcs appeal.</p><figure itemscope data-test=longform-body-image-align itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Les Arcs is particularly popular with families thanks to its beginner-friendly slopes</span></figure><span></span><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Holiday&nbsp;highlight</h2><p>Take the Aiguille Rouge cable car to the summit at 3,226m, the highest peak in Les Arcs, and from here not only do you have gorgeous views of Mont Blanc, Mont Pourri and the Pierra Menta, you also have an epic ski run swooping down reds and blacks to Villaroger, a vertical drop of 2,000m below.&nbsp;</p><p>TravelSki (0800 260 5082; <a rel=nofollow href=#>uk.travelski.com</a>) offers that chance to arrive by train direct from London and stay at Residence Edenarc from £734, based on a group of four, including train travel, transfers from the station, self-catered accommodation and lift pass.

They’re all flanked by seemingly endless pistes and whoop-worthy freeride terrain that never fails to inspire, excite, and satisfy – no matter your level of expertise.

While its reputation as a bolthole for oligarchs and the A-list is not unfounded, its geography, set over five distinct villages ranging from the prestige of Courchevel 1850 to the rustic heart of Courchevel 1300 (Le Praz), cements its appeal to all budgets and abilities. Its five personalities can be upped to six if you include the lower community of Saint Bon, which can be reached on skis when conditions are good but lacks any lifts of its own. While catering to the entire ski spectrum, the resort, where the Prince and Princess of Wales famously went on their first family ski holiday and where Parisians head to be seen and to flash their cash, shone in the Luxuries category – its fine dining blew the closest French competitor out the water. It also topped the French list for the highest number of four-star-plus hotels and après-ski haunts. However, it’s on the slopes, beyond the Rolexes and Palace hotels, that the resort clinched the top spot (454 points). While helped unquestionably by its position at one end of the world’s largest lift-linked ski area – Les Trois Vallées (600km) – Courchevel has stature in its own right with 150km of local pistes backed up by 55 slick lifts, which won it bonus points for lack of queues. Consistent performances in the Location (25km to the nearest stations; 110km to the airport, excluding private landing strips) and Nature categories (thanks to the Vanoise National Park) rounded off Courchevel’s stellar performance in our study – a true ski resort star, who’s sparkle is unchallenged.</p><figure itemscope data-test=longform-body-image-align itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Le Chabichou is one of Courchevel’s world-famous fine-dining spots</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: David Andre</span></figure><span></span><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Holiday&nbsp;highlight</h2><p>Belair is what a French mountain restaurant should be, but rarely is: The menu has barely changed this century – classic French dishes (not a foam in sight), a dozen snails, côtes d’agneau and a gratin Savoyard, all washed down with the house red at €18.

There were bonuses for having direct rail access into the resort centre and car-free streets.</p><p><strong>Terrain</strong> was by far the biggest, and therefore, naturally, the most influential category – after all the crux of a ski holiday is time spent on the mountain. We assigned each resort a score according to its performance in the following criteria: slope altitude, vertical drop, ski area size (both local and linked via lifts and lift passes), the number of resorts that were linked, number of lifts (both local and linked), lift pass price (both local and linked for a six-day period), the number of terrain parks, whether there is a dedicated area for beginners to learn, if heli-skiing is possible, the ability to go cross country skiing and the size of its network, the number of ski schools in the resort and how it fares in terms of lift queues.</p><p>For <strong>Luxuries</strong>, the criteria were as follows: number of four-star and five-star hotels, number of mountain restaurants, number of restaurants in the resort village, how many Michelin stars or Gault Milau toques are held by resort restaurants, number of apres-ski bars, whether the resort hosts an annual music festival and is particularly popular for parties, access to a public swimming pool and spa, the availability of a kids club or nursery and whether the resort actively promotes a sustainability programme.</p><p>The final category, <strong>Nature</strong>, looked at whether the resort is naturally blessed by the key qualities of a winter destination. The criteria were: average annual snowfall, snow depth record, whether the resort and ski area are within a National Park or protected area and the length of its ski season.</p><p>Our Twitter poll was the deciding factor for our people’s champion – an independent survey to gauge the preferences of The Telegraph’s ski and snowboard readers.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour" data-test=subheading itemprop=subheading>Is Courchevel really the world’s greatest ski resort?
