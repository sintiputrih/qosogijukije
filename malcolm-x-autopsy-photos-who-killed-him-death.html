Death Cause And Obituary</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>The Assassination of Malcolm X: A Look Back at the Life, Legacy, and the Controversial Trial of His Killers.</strong></p><p>Malcolm X was a prominent figure during the civil rights movement in the United States. Born in Omaha, he became an African American Muslim minister and founded the Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU).</p><p>However, on February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated in Manhattan, New York City. Six years prior, he gained national attention for speaking on behalf of the Nation of Islam, a Black nationalist group, and for his outspoken criticism of white authorities who abused their power and brutalized Black people.</p><p>Malcolm X was shot several times and died from his injuries. Muhammad Abdul Aziz, Khalil Islam, and Thomas Hagan were charged and given life sentences for their involvement in his assassination.</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=# rel=bookmark>John Edwards Scandal: Engaged In An Affair With Rielle Hunter, Wife, And Kids.</a></p><h2>Malcolm X Autopsy Photos: Who Killed Him?</h2><p>Immediately after Malcolm X’s death, three men were charged with first-degree murder: Thomas Hagan, Muhammad A. Aziz, and Khalil Islam.</p><p>Although witnesses had seen them, there was no physical evidence tying Aziz or Islam to the murder.</p><p>Hagan, also known as Talmadge Hayer or Mujahid Abdul Halim, confessed to the murder and said his two co-defendants were innocent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Malcolm-X.jpg><p>On March 11, 1966, all three were found guilty and faced a life sentence. Despite doubts about their guilt, law enforcement never pursued investigations into Aziz or Islam, and the case remained closed for decades.</p><p>Aziz was eventually paroled in 1985, while Johnson was released in 1989. Hayer was released in 2010 after serving 45 years in prison.</p><p><span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>In 2021, an investigation into the case led to the dismissal of Aziz and Islam after determining that the prosecution was deeply flawed and the men did not get a fair trial. Aziz was 83 at the dismissal time, and Islam had already passed away in 2009.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Some have speculated that the FBI and NYPD were involved in Malcolm X’s assassination, and innocent people were punished.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Liz, the former Chief Researcher on the Malcolm X Project, stated that while Aziz and Islam did not quite fit the story shared through eyewitness reports and FBI informants, it seemed convenient to pin the murder charge on them.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The case was never reopened, and questions about the events leading up to Malcolm X’s death remain unanswered.</span></p><h2>Malcolm X’s Death Cause And Obituary</h2><p>The assassination of Malcolm X occurred on a sunny February day in 1965. At the time, he was only 39 years old.</p><p>Malcolm had arrived at the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan, New York City, where he was scheduled to give a speech to an audience of about 400 people.</p><p>However, the event was disrupted by a dispute among the attendees. As Malcolm & his security team tried to restore order, an individual suddenly ran onto the stage and shot him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Malcolm-X-1.jpg><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Time</a>, two others ran up to the stage and fired. Malcolm was hit 21 times, and the incident unfolded before his pregnant wife and three daughters.</p><p>The assassination of Malcolm X was shocking and traumatic, and it raised many questions and suspicions.</p><p>In 2020, a Netflix documentary series titled “Who Killed Malcolm X?” delved into the incident and explored the possible involvement of law enforcement agencies and other groups in the assassination.</p><p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Sonia Gandhi Death News – Is She Alive Or Not?
