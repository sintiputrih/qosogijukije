Seth complimented Billie’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>blue eyes</a>, as well as his own, before overwhelmingly talking up Daniel’s. “We can’t even be in the same room as that man’s eyes. These look like pinkeye compared to him,” Seth jokingly said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Billie explained that Daniel’s eyes “look crazy” (in a good way), which shocked her when they first met when making No Time To Die.&nbsp;“If you weren’t psyched about it, you’d say, ‘Your eyes are in my personal space,’ ” Seth said. The pair then joked that Seth should ask his wife&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Alexi Ashe</strong></a> if Daniel could be his “hall pass.” These two really do love Daniel Craig!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Also during the interview, Billie explained how she and her brother <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Finneas O’Connell</a></strong> got involved in making the film’s theme song, which earned <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the sibling duo</a> their first-ever Oscar nomination for Best Original Song. “We made the song in October of 2019,” she explained. “This was a long, long time ago. I was 17 when we made it, I’m now 20. It was a very long, kind of strategic process. We were auditioning, pretty much. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>We did our best and worked really hard</a>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5FtZpuhnKG2pnnEoqOiq5hisaK6yJ6jZpuilraoecSynKxlmaPBpr7VopywZaeWwaS0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-shady-side-of-adam-sandler.html><span>←</span><span>The Shady Side Of Adam Sandler</span></a>
