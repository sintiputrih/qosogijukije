Kreischer has made many appearances on Rogan's show, and the two have mostly appeared to be good friends.</p><p>Kreischer discussed his conflict with Rogan candidly in a podcast that he co-hosted with YouTuber Jake Paul. The comedian claims that he talks a lot of "s**t." When he does this in front of individuals who take things seriously, like Rogan, he frequently gets into trouble.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>Joe Rogan and Bert Kreischer: Is there a feud?</h2><p>During the podcast, Kreischer said, "Dude, I talk s**t… There were times Rogan was gonna punch me like I talk wild s**t."</p><p>"When was the time that you thought Rogan was going to fight you?" Jake Paul asked Kreischer and the comic said, "Oh, like, a million times."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>Kreischer continued by discussing all he had shared with Rogan and how seriously he took it all. He disclosed in one of his tales that he had imitated a video that Rogan had posted online, in which the 'JRE' presenter walks his dog.</p><p>Kreischer claimed in his act that he ran four miles, two more than Rogan. After that, the UFC pundit ran 10 and 20 kilometers to defeat Kreischer.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>However, the two have been silent for some time. Kreischer says he occasionally enters Rogan's thoughts. Due to this, Rogan was also forced to cancel "Sober October," a project the comedians had been doing together for years.</p><p>Rogan shared a screenshot of Kreischer refusing to be part of "Sober October," for which the latter faced criticism. Kreischer, however, defended himself by claiming that he attempted to schedule the month in advance with Rogan but that he did not respond.</p><h2 class=split>A 15-year friendship</h2><p>Kreischer has been a regular guest on 'JRE' since the podcast's inception. It has aired over 2000 episodes so far.</p><p>Kreischer has disclosed his acquaintance with Rogan on several occasions. He would often tell the story of how he believed Rogan to be gay. He discussed it with Logan Paul on 'IMPAULSIVE' and with fellow comic Andrew Schulz.</p><p>“When Joe wanted to be friends with me, I was like, ‘You must be gay’. Like, why would you wanna be friends with another man? That didn’t make sense to me,” he said in an 'IMPAULSIVE' episode. “Why would you wanna hang out with him? And then Joe never tried to kiss me once.”</p><p>Kreischer has also shared how Rogan and Ari Shaffir helped him through his dark moments. It is hard to picture Kreischer and Rogan on the outs, despite the possibility of a tiny friendly feud.</p><p>Five years ago, Rogan expressed his pride in all of his buddies, including Joey Diaz, Bert Kreischer, Ari Shaffir, and Tom Segura, on a 'JRE' episode.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRompWnwW630Z6grJuYmr9uwMSlo6xlmpa4pnnPmqylZZiaerCy056lZqGioMButs6eZKunl5a7brDUq6Cnn12fv6Z5wKmnnpmilruksdJmoGaskaG4bsPIpZtmq12p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bachelor-nations-jordan-kimball-engaged-to-christina-creedon.html><span>←</span><span>Bachelor Nations Jordan Kimball Engaged to Christina Creedon</span></a>
