(I am one of them.) Others, <a href=#>not so much</a>. But even the cynics would be a bunch of lying liars if they weren’t at least a bit titillated by the ceremony’s most crowd-pleasing segment, a tradition informally known by most as the all-star jam or super jam. Beginning in the Hall’s inaugural year and appearing in the majority of ceremonies since, the jam is pretty much what it sounds like — a bunch of legends join together on stage, pick up some instruments, and perform the hell out of a rock standard. Unless there’s an underground rich people music club we’re not privy to, there simply isn’t another venue where you can find the likes of Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Ringo Starr rockin’ out in sweet harmony just for funsies.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuydiykn00203h66ssbum6xj@published data-word-count=122>In anticipation of the <a href=#>2019 Rock Hall induction airing on HBO on Saturday</a>, Vulture decided to relive these all-star jams and analyze how truly epic they all were. (A few sporadic years are, sadly, devoid of jams.) We realized a bit into this endeavor that it would be futile to attempt to rank them — how would Tom Petty and Prince compare to Jagger and Springsteen? — so we settled on a general four-tier quadrant of epicness, sorted from the mindblowing must-sees to the ones that would have benefited from more star power, taking into account each jam’s overall execution in addition to its headliners. Either way, let the power of rock compel you, and enjoy this trip down sonic memory lane.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjuydm2li004r3h6699741kvm@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Tier 4: “Meh”</span></h2><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjuydlrel004h3h66vb5jpim2@published>1993: “Born on the Bayou” — John Fogerty, Bruce Springsteen, and Robbie Robertson</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuydiz3z003a3h66fi42yrwv@published data-word-count=41>Just a bunch of pals hangin’ out and croonin’ about bodies of water!

It’s pleasant enough, but when you look at everyone awkwardly relegated to the microphones and realize which inductees didn’t partake — those foxy Roxy Music boys, Stevie Nicks, et al — nostalgia for the glory Hall years of the Springsteens and the Jaggers comes flooding right back. Don’t take our word for it, though. Joe Elliott didn’t even think it was all-star jam material when introducing everyone: “This is a little different. It’s more up to date, less messy, more classic.” Diss alert!</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjuydn0as005y3h66aki8vz5a@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Tier 3: “Epic?

The energy shift from the other late-’80s jams is palpable, though. Everyone is mostly standing around as a yelping Wonder and forever-cucumber-cool Jagger trade lyrics, an exchange that is plagued by some minor sound issues.

But when Stewart <a href=#>unexpectedly couldn’t make the ceremony</a>, things were reshuffled that very afternoon, with Spingsteen and Rose eventually agreeing to do it together with zero preparation. The result? Your very cool, chill uncle wrangling his crazy son to mellow out for five, just five, minutes to appropriately honor a rock legend. (Honestly, find somebody who’ll look at you the same way Rose looks at Springsteen.) Rose would proceed to go on a six-year performance hiatus after this, and 18 years later, <a href=#>refused to attend</a> his own induction with Guns N’ Roses.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjuye9g8q00i53h664qpeu21d@published>1999: “Let It Be” — Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Bono, Bruce Springsteen, Robbie Robertson, Bonnie Raitt, and Billy Joel</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuyduadn00cg3h66bagjd6ih@published data-word-count=84>1999 was an epic year for soloist inductions into the Hall, with McCartney, Springsteen, and Joel forming a holy trifecta of intimidation. <a href=#>Fun fact</a>: The Beatles legend asserted he wasn’t going to perform, but, perhaps overcome by how incredible the backing ensemble was, unexpectedly relieved Joel of his vocal duties a minute into the song, much to the bonkers reaction of everyone. Come for McCartney’s amusing guitar-less hand motions, and stay for his skeptical look at Robertson’s guitar solo.

Let’s break this down by the numbers: There are three bassists, three guitarists, and a sole drummer taking all the madness in. Points are only deducted because Lars Ulrich decided to unexpectedly stop drumming (???) a few minutes into the song — a much-covered Tiny Bradshaw standard — depriving us of what could’ve been even more shreddin’ goodness.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjuyear8w00jd3h66yuhvigdz@published>2017: “Rockin’ in the Free World” — Pearl Jam, Yes, Journey, Rush, and Dhani Harrison</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuyduadq00ck3h66eetslyog@published data-word-count=116>It’s scientifically proven that adding Eddie Vedder’s vocals to any song will make it sound damn fine, so it’s a shame Neil Young — who was set to induct Pearl Jam, but had <a href=#>to drop out</a> days before due to an illness — couldn’t join his peers for this sparkling rendition. (Those guitars! Wowza!) Some great visuals to behold, ranked in no particular order: Two Pearl Jam drummers sharing one drum set; Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson frequently sharing Shit, this is great stares; and Vedder taking a wine bottle from an audience member for a quick chug.

(With Berry as their overlord, of course.) This jam session epitomizes their talents — they manage to transform a two-and-a-half minute song into a seven-minute guitar solo face-off, all while Berry manages to duckwalk like it’s 1956 all over again. We recommend keeping eyes on Richards’ awe-struck gaze throughout the entire song, as well as Joel’s, who’s clearly pissed to be stuck behind a piano.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjuyeed9s00kl3h6625bjxcvw@published>1988: “I Saw Her Standing There” — George Harrison, Bruce Springsteen, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Ronnie Wood, Les Paul, Brian Wilson, Jeff Beck, Ringo Starr, Diana Ross, Neil Young, and Billy Joel</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjuydxalz00da3h661yabk7ar@published data-word-count=82>You know you’re in for a collaborative thrill of a lifetime when, due to space reasons, the Rock Hall has to designate Starr, Joel, and Young as “others” on its website — a complete lineup that arguably hasn’t been able to be amplified in any venue since. This is joy personified, right down to Harrison doing the “wooooos!” bobblehead style, and Jagger and Springsteen switching off tambourine duty. Is that even a rare smile on Dylan’s face?

(Nice.) And frankly, how could it not be? Between Petty’s gentle vocals and strumming, and then Prince bulldozing through — and almost falling off — the stage while giving a master class in shredding, there’s perhaps no better way to posthumously remember these two titans than by seeing them honor another one. (George Harrison was inducted as a soloist that year.) Petty would later say in an interview that Prince barely practiced his solo, which is just wild to think about. “You see me nodding at him, to say, ‘Go on, go on,’” <a href=#>he recalled</a>. “I remember I leaned out at him at one point and gave him a ‘This is going great!’ kind of look. He just burned it up.
