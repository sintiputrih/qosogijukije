In a new video with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Vogue</a> the actress is taking a look back at some of her most iconic looks — including one that even keeps her kids in line.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the clip, Lively reminisced about her 2018 "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination" Met Gala gown. "This, is without a doubt my favorite look of all time," she said of the striking burgundy dress. "The is the Met Gala 2018, Versace dress. I get very involved in the design of the dresses, I don't know if it's just that I'm a Virgo, or that I need a life."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This one is actually a dress that they had made, but it had a train that was like this — it was a shorter train," she continued. "So, we took this dress, and said, 'Ok, can you guys add like 8 feet of train? Can you add beading on the inside?' This had ruching in the middle, which kind of looked like it was too tight and pulling at the hips, so I was like, 'We need to pick up that pattern here as well, so that it looks like a part of the dress.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In case you forgot, the dress took the world's collective breath away when Lively arrived at the stairs of the Met, the actress's old Gossip Girl stomping grounds. And now she's sharing that even her daughters, James, Inez, and Betty, are impressed by the look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's something that when my kids are giving me attitude, I'm like, 'This is your mom.' I mean come on — I try to tell them that I'm real-life royalty and that they're lucky that I'm raising them," she laughed. "They don't buy it. They don't believe it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also addressed her knack for matching the carpet year after year. When she was assigned <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>co-host</a> for the 2022 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Met Gala</a>, she told Anna Wintour that she needed to find a way to twin with the stairs again. "I went to Anna beforehand and I said, 'I know there's a lot of pressure, but I really need to match the carpet this year because we set a precedent. But somehow, I don't know — whoever this carpet designer [is], we're soulmates."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8GlmKSdXaG2t7HLsmabpJGgsm64yK%2BcpbFdoLalv4xrZ2pwXaKytXnGmqOaZaaav7Stwp5koKenow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./before-the-show-leaves-the-network-may-2006-schedule-12478.html><span>←</span><span>Before the show leaves the network...
