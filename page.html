It’s a genius mashup of those two yummy things: classic Greek salad ingredients – olives, tomatoes, onions, feta, romaine, and artichokes – over a hearty whole wheat pizza crust. I wish I could take credit for this fantastic combination, but today the recipe (and&nbsp;all of the ingredients to make it), came&nbsp;from Hello Fresh, the healthy meal kit delivery service. We tried out their veggie box last week and are here to report back with our stamp of approval!

Jack, our resident beet-hater, was skeptical as I made this, but he ended up loving it. But what really excites me is the color. It’s so bright and vibrant – exactly what&nbsp;I feel like eating in the middle of winter when the days are bleak and grey. Ok, that’s an exaggeration because it’s actually super sunny here today. But if it’s grey where you are – try out this beet hummus recipe.

When we first started talking about this book (nearly 2 years ago!), the year 2016 felt like a lifetime away.&nbsp;It’s no joke, the process of publishing a book is LONG! But here we are – 120 recipes, roughly 300 photos and 1 broken dishwasher later – and it’s now available for preorder and will be out March 29th! So what’s the book about? Simple, beautiful cooking with fresh seasonal ingredients. The recipe chapters are organized by vegetable so that your cooking inspiration can start where mine does – the farmer’s…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>I have to admit, I can’t wait to see some food trends, even the healthy ones, come to an end. I felt this way about chia pudding for, oh, about three years… but it’s all over now. I’ve joined the chia seed pudding club, and I’m in love. My chia relationship was an unfair one from the start. At first, I judged chia seeds because I thought those little gray balls just looked funny. Then came all of those gorgeous chia bowls floating around the internet, and they made me almost want to try chia, but not quite. Earlier this…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>A few weeks ago, we flew out of Chicago just before the snow started falling and the temps dropped below zero. This year, unlike most winters, we got lucky. If you’re in the midwest (or another frigid location) – my heart goes out to you. I don’t know how you do it, but here are ten of of my favorite healthy soup recipes that will hopefully help warm & nourish the soul. I make these all the time, but I want to know – what are you favorite soups?

Well now it’s your chance to go on that exact same trip, hosted by the lovely folks at Fortessa. You’ll get to stay at the gorgeous Fairmont hotel, attend&nbsp;cooking class at the original Williams Sonoma Store, and of course have amazing food and wine the whole time. It was tons of fun (click here to enter)&nbsp;my fingers are crossed for you! Now back to the recipe!

If you’ve been following for long you’ll know that I haven’t always been the biggest fan of it. But here’s what I’ve learned: it’s best to get the “spaghetti” thought out of your mind. As pasta, it’s kind of mushy. As a roasted vegetable that happens to form into little strands, it’s so delicious. Especially with a squeeze of lemon and a few dollops of pesto. And if you’re new to spaghetti squash, head over to this post to read my favorite tips for cooking it. For texture and crunch, I tossed the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s my birthday today, which is timely, because I couldn’t be more excited to share that this apple cinnamon muffin recipe kicks off a series of posts I’ve been working on for Anthropologie(!!). Pinch me. First up are these sweet apple cinnamon muffins that I baked up in this&nbsp;super sweet&nbsp;ceramic muffin pan. How to Make Healthy Apple Muffins These healthy apple muffins are pure&nbsp;apple-cinnamon-ey goodness coming out of the oven. With their full flavor, you’d never guess that they’re on the healthy side. Here’s what makes them a good-for-you treat: Sunflower oil takes the place of butter.

When I was in college, I’d stock up on frozen vegetables&nbsp;because I was broke and they were&nbsp;4 for $1 at Publix. I’d mix the frozen veggies with instant brown rice and drown it all&nbsp;in soy sauce. While I appreciated the bargain, that dinner was “healthy” for healthy’s sake, and I’d try to convince myself it was delicious while my roommates all ate pizza. Now, I love to make this actually delicious stir fry with lots of fresh vegetables, like baby&nbsp;bok…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>We’re en route to snowy Chicago today and I’m trying to think warm thoughts. Yes, I grew up there, but I’m such a baby about winter. Scraping car windows, not being able feel my fingers & toes – I did it for years & it’s just not my thing. BUT I’m excited to spend a little time with my family, eat some good food, and probably cook a little. On the menu, obviously, will be warm food like this hot & hearty vegetable-packed soup. This is my take on minestrone although&nbsp;it’s a little less than traditional – it’s in between…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I freaking love pesto.&nbsp;I make it all the time&nbsp;– usually with any herbs, greens, nuts, or seeds I have around. I like to swirl it into my soups, top it onto my eggs, or&nbsp;dollop it onto big salad-ey grain bowls. While there are one or two (or twelve)&nbsp;pesto recipes on this site already, I really love this&nbsp;version, so I think there’s room for one more. Before I started the&nbsp;blog, I would have never imagined just how many people are allergic to nuts. So in the spirit of the healthy new year, this tasty pesto is dairy-free, gluten-free (obviously), and nut-free…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfpa6osY5qZ2xn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doug-ondler-obituary-doug-ondler-has-passed-away.html><span>←</span><span>Doug Ondler Obituary, Doug Ondler Has Passed Away</span></a>
