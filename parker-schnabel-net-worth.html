Everything that happens is moved by hand, almost. Though there are some excavators.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Parker Schnabel</strong></p><p>“The toughest thing is that it’s very seasonal work and we basically have four months to make a year’s worth of money, not only is it difficult but it is also dangerous because everybody is working long hours, long days … from a safety standpoint, that’s risky.”&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;Parker Schnabel</strong></p><p>“I don’t know, you just kind of get focused on working and most of the time it doesn’t bother you too much. If I need to let some steam off I have a dirt bike and I go for a ride. I love riding my bike.”&nbsp;<strong>– Parker Schnabel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I’d say overall the first time I went out to Dawson was really enjoyable and getting to know everyone there. It’s just a wonderful mining community that’s made up of some of the best people in the world and I’m really glad to have become, or feel like I’m becoming a part of that.”&nbsp;<strong>– Parker Schnabel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“There are some big problems on the horizon, some pretty big headwinds are coming.
