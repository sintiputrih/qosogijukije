Like benevolent trade winds on a typical island day, the Festivals of Aloha will continue to breeze through Maui Nui with Hawaiian culture, food, music, parades and activities at fun community events on Maui, Lanai and Molokai.
 This year’s festivities started on Sept. 7 at the Wailuku First Friday party, then moved to the The Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua for a falsetto contest, followed by events at the world-famous Banyan Tree in Lahaina and even more Hawaiian pomp and pageantry Friday at the Queen Ka’ahumanu Center in Kahului."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

On Saturday, it will ferry over to the island of Lanai.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Enjoy an evening on Lanai and return on the Expeditions with a complimentary ferry,”</span> says Festivals of Aloha Director Daryl Fujiwara. <span class=quotations>“Just purchase a $5 ribbon at Bailey House or Native Intelligence in Wailuku and enjoy a free return ride at 9:15 p.m.”</span></p><p>The annual Lanai festivities will kick up its heels from 2 to 8 p.m. at iconic Dole Park in cool Lanai City.</p><img width=430 height=350 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2018/09/23065103/12-PAUMakaniTabura-Emcee.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Lanai emcee Makana Tabura -- Photo courtesy Festivals of Aloha</p><p>This year, the entertainers will be Natalie Ai Kamauu, Na Wai ‘Eha, A Touch of Gold and more to be announced along with hula dancers, cultural demonstrations, free keiki activities, crafters and artisans and ono eats. Emcee will be <span class=quotations>“Lanai boy”</span> Makana Tabura.</p><p><span class=quotations>“My vision is to turn Festivals of Aloha on Lanai into the center of Hana Noeau, or things that Hawaiians make,”</span> says Fujiwara. <span class=quotations>“Go there and collect all of your lauhala, feathers and shells. Get your laau lapaau, or Hawaiian herbal medicine, say, like mamaki tea. I want it to be an economic engine for Lanai.”</span></p><p>Contests on Hawaiian attire, lei and keiki art will attract competition. And Hawaiian crafts may be watched and learned.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Wear your best aloha shirt or muumuu, string a lei and enter to win,”</span> says Fujiwara. “We’ll also offer the Lauhala Workshop at 11:30 a.m. in Dole Park with kumu ulana (weaver) Lorna Pacheco of Oahu. Please RSVP by emailing sfdhawaii@gmail.com.</p><p>Since Dole Park, where all of the activities take place, is located about 20 minutes away from Manele Harbor and the ferry, those who wish to attend will need ground transportation.

All I can say is, you just gotta go to Dole Park and try it all. It’s everybody’s food. So go there and be hungry. There will be laulau plates, fried ice cream and so many foods from the island. This year, there will even be a parade around Dole Park.”</span></p><p>Lanai FOA coordinator is Nani Watanabe. A Lanai native, she now resides in Kahului and works for Maui Economic Opportunity, Inc. as the Maui Independent Living Center program agent.</p><p>The Festivals of Aloha island hops over to Molokai for fun-filled days and nights Oct. 5 and 6 in Kaunakakai town.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Molokai is such as strong staple,”</span> Fujiwara explains. <span class=quotations>“Each and every year, they plan their event to a ‘T.’ The whole town is invested in making it the best ever.”</span></p><p>Photo ops will be abundant at the Investiture of the Royal Court. It’s a traditional Hawaiian ceremony at 6 p.m. Oct. 5 at Mitchell Pauole Center.

The public may enter dishes made out of all three of these canoe plants, and samples will be given away after judging.</p><p><span class=quotations>“The public enters their own dishes and as long as it tastes wonderful, it will be good,”</span> says Rachel Dudoit, the Molokai Festivals of Aloha coordinator and the kumu for Moana’s Hula Halau that will perform at the Investiture on the Friendly Isle.</p><p><span class=quotations>“The Molokai musical lineup for Oct. 5 will kick off with Keaka at 5:45 p.m., followed by headliner Kainani Kahaunaele at 8 p.m. and Sly Dog at 9 p.m.,”</span> says Fujiwara.</p><p><span class=quotations>“There will be food booths and non-food vendors.

Watch pa’u riders on horseback, country-style floats with exotic flowers and community members marching.</p><img width=648 height=540 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2018/09/23065059/15-PAUKainaniKahaunaele2.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Molokai headliner Kainani Kahaunaele will perform Oct. 5. -- Photo courtesy Festivals of Aloha</p><p>Following the parade at 11 a.m. will be the Ho’olaule’a at the Mitchell Pauole Center.

She gave it to Crystal Smythe, her daughter and my aunt, and she then handed this event to me.”</span></p><p>And his events are culturally expressive and fun, too.</p><p>Hana will also make a splash with the Shore Line Fishing Contest at Hana Bay from 7 a.m. to noon Oct. 7, followed by Play Day at Hana Bay at noon with net throwing, water balloon toss, hula hoop contest and food booths. Then head to Sports Night at Hana Ball Park with tennis and volleyball and food booths open to the public with ono grinds.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Every night in Hana is very well attended,”</span> says Leinaala Estrella new Hana coordinator, whose day job is at Alu Like, a nonprofit with a mission to help Native Hawaiians reach their potential.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It’s a tradition in Hana that has been going on for years. It’s a great time for visitors. They have a great time when they come and meet the local people.”</span></p><p>The Kupuna Luncheon for seniors will be held Oct. 9 at the Travaasa Hana hotel. For reservations and cost, call 248-8211., ext. 3284.</p><p>On Oct. 10, the Hana Arts annual Talent Show will take over Hana Ball Park from 5 to 9 p.m. with home-grown talent to the nines. Of course, food will be plentiful.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It’s great fun and a special evening under the Hana moon with $1,000 in cash prizes and celebrity judges,”</span> Fujiwara says. <span class=quotations>“It’s beautiful to see all the kids come together to show their talent. And it serves as a preliminary to the Brown Bags to Stardom competition that is held statewide.”</span></p><p>On Oct 11, Hana Dragons will host its football home game from 7 to 9 p.m. in Hana Ball Park.</p><p>On Oct. 12, Kahanu Garden will feature the Ulu Cook Off at Hana Ball Park with pro chefs as judges, food demos and yummy samples. Again, food booths will be open to the public. It’s also Hawaiiana Night from 7 to 10 p.m. with arts, crafts, Holoku and Malo Fashion Contests along with <span class=quotations>“mele,”</span> or song, and hula.</p><p>Golfers will want to get in on the Cross Country Golf at Holani Hale from 1 to 4 p.m. Oct. 13.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Bring three clubs and nine junk golf balls,”</span> Fujiwara says. <span class=quotations>“Shoes and ribbon required. It costs $5 to be eligible for pupule (crazy) prizes. Sign up for start times that will be at 15 minute intervals.”</span></p><p>Hana’s grand finale will be Oct. 13 as Festivals of Aloha Ho’ike Night and there is a $10 presale cost.</p><p><span class=quotations>“The gates open at 5 p.m. at Hana Bay and the event runs from 6 to 10 p.m.,”</span> Estrella says. <span class=quotations>“It’s a special evening of local cuisine and the live music of Na Wai Eha, Loeka and Longakit featuring Damon Williams and Keaiwa.”</span></p><p>For more information, call Estrella 281-7882 or email hanafestivalsofaloha@gmail.com.</p><p><span class=quotations>“That week in Hana is when the Department of Education has its fall intersession and kids are off school,”</span> Fujiwara says. <span class=quotations>“So it’s a school break. Bring your family and get your Waianapanapa cabin, camp out or shack up at your aunty’s house and check out all of these events.”</span></p><p>Festivals of Aloha is made possible through support of the County of Maui and Hawaii Tourism Authority.</p><p>For overall event info, you may email Fujiwara at sfdhawaii@gmail.com.</p><p>* Carla Tracy can be reached at carlatracy@mauinews.com.</p><p>_______________</p><p>Maui Nui events at a glance:</p><p>• Where: The fest continues with the next event Saturday on Lanai; Molokai follows with two days of pageantry, food, music and culture Oct. 5 and 6; Hana jumps Oct. 6 through 13.</p><p>• How much: Most events are free and open to the public.
