When he was seventeen, he was preparing to stop acting and modeling, but was asked to audition for what would be his first film, Men Don't Leave (1990).

He played a part in Kinsey (2004), which appeared in theaters in the year 2004.</p><p>Chris took time off from acting to spend time with his wife, Caroline, son, Chris Jr., and his daughter Lilly.
